At this time i would like to turn the call over to. Thanks matt good morning. I'll share a broad commentary on a consolidated performance for the quarter and then mike laroche will provide details on our financial results after which rusty gordon will conclude our prepared remarks. Weather outlook. After i prepared remarks will be pleased to take your questions. Before i begin discussing our results i first like to send our best wishes and thoughts to all those impacted by hurricane ian. Including many of our own associates. We're all grateful for the first responders and safety professionals who are playing a critical role in keeping people safe. And rescuing those in danger. As people in the affected area work to rebuild their homes and property our legend brands disaster restoration business. And our tremco waterproofing business are responding. To help return their lives to some sense of normalcy. For example in our tremco weatherproofing technologies inc business associates drove 8 hours to obtain additional supplies and preparation for the storm. And use one instance chainsaws to clear down trees to reach a commercial customer in need. These include hospitals in schools. Additionally one of our supervisors in central florida steve reeves came in late friday evening the night before his son's wedding. To ensure that our crews would be able to patch a customer's roof saturday morning. These examples demonstrate the commitment. We take it serving our customers. And we will do our part to help the affected regions recover as quickly as possible. Now turning to our results if you look at slide 3 in our powerpoint presentation. The first quarter was a positive one for rpm despite several market and macroeconomic challenges. Revenues grew by double digits in all of our segments to reach a record for the first quarter and are adjusted ebit margins recovered resulting in all-time record high adjusted ebit for rpm. Well supply conditions remain tight material availability did improve throughout the quarter. This is primary result of measures our teams have taken including using our corsicana texas plant. For self-source raw materials. Are r&d and procurement personnel have fought throughout the supply chain challenges by identifying new sources of raw materials and qualifying them to ensure our customers. Received the quality products they expect from us. This collaboration which is occurring across rpm's businesses has allowed us to better meet customer and a man. Add resiliency to our supply chain and realize additional savings. From our map 2025. Margin achievement plan. During the first quarter we generated 30 million dollars at incremental map savings. Which were a key driver in achieving record-adjusted. The positive momentum in sales growth we achieved in fiscal year 22 continued during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. And i'm exceedingly proud of our associate's ability to overcome macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain challenges. And convert this sales growth into expanded margin. In approving profitability. Turning to slide four you'll see all four segments generated double digit sales growth. Resulting in record first quarter revenue. Consolidated unit volume increased approximately 5%. Well pricing on a consolidated basis increased on average of 15%. As we work to catch up with continuing cost inflation. The increased year over year 28%. In the first quarter. Driven by operational efficiencies including the 30 million of map 2025 savings. Pricing initiatives and three of our four segments achieved. Strong adjusted even growth. With our performance coatings group and specially products group achieving record results. And consolidated even margins expanded by approximately 170 basis points. Looking at sales by geography on slide 5. Growth was led by north america our largest market which generated 80% of our first quarter revenue. Demand in north america was strong and we generated good sales growth across all of our segments. Emerging markets also perform well during the first quarter with double-digit revenue growth in latin america asia pacific. In africa in the middle east. Europe which comprised 13% of overall sales in the first quarter was the outlier with revenue down 8.5%. Which drove operating earnings down in the region 35% quarter over quarter. These declines resulted from the challenging macroeconomic conditions in europe exacerbated by rapid inflation. Our construction products group and performance coding screw which have relatively sizable presence in europe. Healthy impact of these challenging market conditions most acutely. I'll answer the call over to michael laroche to discuss our consolidated segment financial results. In more detail. Thanks frank. Regenerated record first quarter consolidated net sales of 1.93 billion in increase of 17.1%. Compared to the 1.65 billion reported in the prior fiscal year period. Organic sales growth was 19.5%. Or 321.9 million. Acquisitions contributed 1% to sales for 16 million. The foreign exchange was a headwind that decreased sales by 3.4%. 456 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a record. $1.47. Represents an. 36.1%. Compared to the $1.08. Reported in the year ago quarter. Are consolidated adjusted ebay. Increased 33.1% to an all-time record $275.3 million. Compared to 206.8 million. Reported in the prior year period. Construction products group generated first quarter record net sales. $729.7 million. An increase of 13.2% compared to the fiscal 2022 first quarter. Organic sales growth was 15.8%. Acquisitions contributing 1.9%. In foreign currency translation headwinds reducing sales by 4.5%. Roofing systems generated strong growth and benefited from increased public sector spending. It's turnkey service model and a focus on renovations. Add mixture and repair products for concrete also grew strongly during the quarter as the business gains share. Geographically asia pacific markets performed well. Well sales and earnings decline significantly in europe and canada where cpg is more concentrated compared to rpm overall. Europe experience severe inflation and macroeconomic challenges. What canada was negatively impacted by str. A concrete shortages that impeded the completion of construction projects. And led to ineffici. East market challenges in europe and canada were key drivers of adjusted ebay. Which was found 5.1% to 111.2 million. Compared to 117.2 million. In the prior year period. Additionally the corsicana plant rolls up through. And resulted in a negative financial impact during the first quarter as a as a facility increases production. Toward oil capacity. Fx and mix also negatively impacted. Partially offsetting these head. Which was a positive contributor to adjust. Performance coatings groups fiscal 2023 first quarter net sales were a record $340.4 million. An increase of 19.2% for the prior year period. Organic sales increase 23.6%. Acquisitions did not impact sales. The foreign currency translation was a 4.4% headwind. Boring systems protective coatings and frp grading all generated double-digit growth. These businesses are well positioned to benefit from the trend of reshoring manufacturing to the us. Additionally. Energy markets continue to generate strong growth as did emerging markets. Pricing management also contributed to the strong. Justin bieber increase 27.6% to a record 47.9 million. In the first quarter of physical 2023. The growth was driven by positive volum. Selling price increases. And sales management was generated favorable mix. Partially offsetting these positive factors. Was foreign exchange. To adjust. Especially products group reported record net sales of 202.7 million for the first quarter of physical 2023. An increase of 11.3% compared to the period a year ago. Organic sales increase 12.8%. Acquisitions added 0.6%. And foreign currency translation was a headwind. 2.1%. Record first quarter sales were driven by stren. In the food coatings and additive. Whose new management team positioned this operating unit to benefit from increased institutional demand. That's pandemic restrictions were lifted. The disaster restoration equipment business also grew its top line as we work through backlogs caused by previous semiconductor chip short. Towing price increases in response to continued cost inf. Also contributed to robin. Sdgs adjusted ebay of 29.6 million was a first quarter record and an increase of 18.9%. Compared to adjust 24.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by improved sales and pricing. As well as fixed cost leverage resulting from higher production. In the disaster restoration equipment. Consumer group achieved record first quarter net sales of $659.5 million in physical 2023. An increase of 22.5% compared to the first quarter of physical 2022. Organic sales increase 24.1%. Acquisitions added 0.4%. If foreign currency translation was a headwind. The consumer groups revenue growth was driven by improved supply of key alkid resins produced by the corsicana manufacturing facility. Required last september. As well as from new suppliers who are teams worked hard to qualify. This increase in supply allowed us to better meet customer demand. Price increase in response to continuous inflation also contributed to the strong revenue growth. Consumer groups adjusted ebay in the fiscal 2023 first quarter was 117.1 million. An increase of nearly 150% 150%. Compared to adjust the ebit a 46.9 million dollars reported for the prior year period. When sales and profitability suffered. Severe supply short. Resulting from a plant explos. At an alcat resin supplier. The growth was driven by map operational eff. He's ever realized as a result of. Material supply. Pricing increases in response to continue cost inflation. Also contributed to adjusted ebit. Approaching long-term averages. I would like to provide an update on capital allocation and structure. During the first quarter of physical 2023. We repurchased 25 million of shares. I paid dividends of 51.4 million. These actions demonstrate our long-held commitment to enhance shareholder value by returning capital. Drake trying to work capital structure. We took actions to enhance our balance sheet strength and flexibility. We increased the size of our revolving credit facility by 50 million dollars to 1.35 billion dollars. An extended its term to august. 2027. This credit facility provides us the flexibility to implement strategic initiatives including map 2025 and m&a. Additionally we prepaid 50 million of our term lo. Extended it's maturity to august 2025 from february 2023. You outstanding principal on this term loan is now 250 million. As a result we only have modest repayment requirements through 2026. With that i'll turn the call over to rust. To discuss our outlook. Thank you mike. As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Several of the challenges we faced in the first quarter. Are expected to continue and possibly intensify. Supply chains are improving both from our initiatives and market conditions but remain tight. And any disruptions can delay the realization of benefits. From the execution of our growth initiatives. A strong us dollars expected to continue to be a headwind. To both sales and adjusted ebit growth. Particularly in our cpg and pcg businesses. Which have a larger percentage of their sales. Outside the us. From a macroeconomic perspective europe is expected to be challenged by high inflation. An impacts from the war in the ukraine. In the us persistently high inflation. And rising interest rates. Have increased economic uncertainty and the possibility of an economic downturn. Even with this uncertainty we are confident that the strategic actions we have taken. Position us to succeed in the second quarter and beyond. These include. Number one actions to further improve material supply. Number two. Implementing map 2025 initiatives. Number three. Positioning our businesses to benefit from the reassuring of manufacturing. To the us. And continued infrastructure. And stimulus spending. And number four. Diversifying our portfolio of businesses. Which have limited exposure to china and autos. Well focusing on sustainability. Including maintenance restoration and energy efficiency. As a result we anticipate that second quarter sales growth. On a consolidated basis will increase 9 to 12%. Led by consumer. Which is expected to continue to benefit from better material supply. And pricing increases in response. To continued inflation. Physical 2023 second quarter consolidated adjusted ebay. Is expected to increase by 30 to 40%. As we benefit from map 2025 savings. And favorable comparisons. To the second quarter of fiscal 2022. When we were challenged by severe supply chain disruptions. This concludes our prepared comments we will now be pleased to take your questions. We will now take our first. John. Good morning frank and congratulations and cross the board really solid results. So i wanted to understand the consumer business maybe a little bit better cuz it was definitely stronger than we thought and i guess they were kind of two parts that the top. One and the margin side on the top line. I guess how reflective is that of kind of the current demand environment and is there like a catch up because i know alk is kind of held you back from stocking the shelves in the past like was there a little bit of a ketchup or or you actually seeing that kind of point of sale demand right now and then on the margin front you know again the margins definitely came back faster than we thought and and it seems like you've got an even better handle on the outfit situation or came back faster than than we thought i guess is is that a fair characterization of the quarter where there's some one time things that may be benefited you and maybe we shouldn't be thinking about this as a good kind of normal run rate going forward i guess how how would you characterize that. Sure. So john let me start with some big picture. Comments that will then get specific your questions on consumer. So i commented on. Our organic growth and the split which is roughly 5%. Unit volume on a consolidated basis in 15% price. You know. Neither weed or any of our competitors provide. Specific price detailer or at a segment level. But with that guidance. We had higher than average price increases in consumer. You know that's consistent with the historic patterns of. Getting price typically at a 6 to 9 month lag. To what we get in other parts of our pm so. You can see that in our results a year ago where we were really challenged and operating it at historic low. Margin levels and low profitability. That was part of it so lag and pricing relative to raw material cost increases which were now catching up on. Second issue is clearly material. We moved aggressively to be able to source. Our own outlet resins with the purchase of the corsa cana plant in texas last september. And that has helped us significantly we believe. To catch up. Demand that we weren't in the industry wasn't able to meet because of this alkid resin shortfall. And then lastly. You know map 2025 is something that we have been working on for a year. We in a rusty and i had hoped to. Introduce it and provide more detail before now. As you know we have an investor day which will be webcast on friday. That will provide more details on that 2025. We were waiting for a more stable period of time. And you know it it started to feel like waiting for godot because there has not been a more stable period of time in the last 2 years that i don't think it's very stable today. I say all that because we have been designing and and beginning to implement map 2025 over the last. Let's call it 6 months plus. And. Better than half of that work initially has been at our consumer group. And so if you you know you look at the adjustments of consulting fees and other fees. We had a lot to do with a lot of work to do on operating efficiencies and an siop. Efficiencies. Particularly consumer so there's been a lot of work on that in the last year. Those three things i think combined to generate. The strong recovery. At consumer. The last comment i will make and then and then i'll stop and answer additional questions is that. Despite the strong quarter. I only at our performance coatings group. Are we operating at record ebit margin. We are not back to record either margins at construction products at specially products or at consumer. So we still have some more work to do both in terms of executing on map 2025. And on addressing. Cost price mix issues that have been. Driven by the inflationary environment that. Got it no that that's that's hugely helpful on the car maybe i can ask just as the follow-up. On the construction segment cuz it you actually kind of point it gave a good segue on that so the margin in that one when i look at one queue was was down about 300 basis points from from the prior year and and even the year before that now you highlighted a couple different things that might have impacted it and so i'd love to get a little bit better understanding on it you know you mentioned it was a strike there was a concrete shortages you also have the course of canada plant that's now in here and maybe is. Kind of running on all cylinders quite yet i guess can you unpack how we should be thinking about the margins degradation in that business and how. You know how to think about that going forward as maybe some of these things reverse themselves. Sure. So the corsicana plant is owned and operated by our construction products group. The primary beneficiary of owning that facility so far has been our consumer group and in particular rust-oleum relative to. Introducing acrylic resin production there. It carries a. Cost. Of about 3 million bucks negative per quarter. And so. You know we're working to fill up that capacity and and we have every belief that we will do so successfully both with some external production as well as. More internal production across from different chemical products. But right now that cost is born on the on the eb. At p&l of our construction products group. Europe is something we talked about when we talked to investors in july and are concerns have been borne out. Europe's in a recession our biggest exposure. In europe is in our construction products group whether it's in the uk and or on the continent. And so energy costs are a mess inflation is is a. Happened a little later and so a little bit bigger than what we're seeing now in north america. Our ability to get a price there in the construction products group you know because of europe. I talked about the average price on a consolidated basis of 15% in the construction products group was actually somewhat less. Then the average across all of our pm. And then the canadian situation surprised us but i think it's circumstantial. You know this is a quarter that happened over the summer months. And is your recall. Significant trucking strikes. They're also is not the new cement capacity in north america particularly in canada for probably 20 years. And so there is been a cement and related concrete shortage that's particularly been a problem in canada although it is somewhat of an issue in the us. And that negatively impacted. Both revenue base and. Profit margin profile of new dura in particular. Because a concrete has been shorted to. Residential and light commercial versus infrastructure or more heavy indust. Got it thanks very much for the color frank. Thanks john. John roberts from credit sues. You can credit please you can go ahead with your question. Morning thanks congratulations. Morning congratulations on the quarter and look forward to friday. Where are alkyd resin prices. Versus last quarter in a year ago now. And would you say outfits are now in line with the other resins and we'll basically just follow oil prices with a lag. So i don't i'll let rusty answer the specific there i can tell you in the quarter. Inflation was up court year over year by 28% and sequentially from q4 up about two and a half percent. I have to leave and rusty for a more specifics more than double. Over. Increase. What was the second part of your. Where they are relative to other resins and will they basically just lag oil prices from here forward. Yeah and in terms of alkyd resins. Those have been affected by. A variety of raw materials besides oil you know they do incorporate. Certain components of. Plant-based oils that. We had difficulty getting out of. Russia in the ukraine. So there's a number of things besides oil that will impact that. As. Probably remember we had a major supplier outage. Over a year ago in north america. So supply has been tight. We have ramped up. Insourcing at our corsicana facility. But that does not. Take care of most of our requirements it's a small percentage. So we still rely on. The alkyd resin market. It's way up. Infl. Could you talk about your exposure to rising interest rates that offset part of the upside and eb. Sure in general. I think rusty and his team have done a pretty good job there. I'm about 60% of our debt capital structure is fixed. With an average duration of almost 13 years. And a average interest cost of 4.1%. And so the latest piece of that was a 10-year bond that was done in january of this year at 2.95%. So we've got some really solid interest rate protection there. The remaining 40% is floating rate and you know still at rates below are fixed rates. And part of our capital allocation strategy in the. In the two and a half year period of map 2025 is to reduce. Some of those that levels. Thank you. All right though our next question comes from. Mike harrison from seaport research partners. Morning mike good morning. Congratulations on the nice quarter. The impressive. Was wondering if frank you're willing to talk at all about the second half. Of physical 23 cuz you're doing something like 35% year on your ebay. The first half based on your guid. And what you just delivered. The cops do get a little bit more challenging in the second half. But i think we don't appreciate maybe some initial thoughts on what even growth could look like in the second half. I kind of based on what you know at this point which i am i'm conscious that there's a lot of uncertainty out there. Sure. You know what we provided guidance for q2 and i think as we sit here today. We're pretty comfortable with that guidance recognizing there's still tons of volatility. You know when we talk to investors in july about q1 we did not anticipate. The challenges that happened to our construction products group in canada for instance again we think those are circumstantial behind us. So the q2 guidance is there given the seasonality of our q3. And the benefits of our math 2025 program. I think that we're likely to have a pretty solid. Q3 performance. Might be on that i think who knows you know we are. Aware that. Fundamental primary chemicals have dropped. Meaningfully. Dad is not showing up in the paint coatings industries. Purchased chemicals yet as i said we've had 28%. Inflation year over year in q1. What happens in europe. Relative to the russian war on ukraine and its impact on energy costs. And economic activity particularly in the winter is hard to know. So. I i would. It's impossible for us to venture beyond my com. All right that's that's fair enough and then i was wondering if you could comment on. You're still. Within the consumer business and maybe any shelf space wins and losses. As you're kind of exiting this heavier season and starting to look at the next. Sure depending on the product line. Across all of our consumer group and this is principally in north american commentary. Garfield race range anywhere from the the mid-70s to mid-90s. That is not at the 98 or 99% that our customers expect or that we delivered for decades. But it's substantially better. Then. You know 50 to 60% feel rates. That we and others in our industry were operating at. In fiscal 22 and you know part of physical 21 is a result of all the supply chain shortages. So there's been significant recovery there and you can see that in our consumer group results. But we still have more work to do and and we are utilizing outside consult. On manufacturing and operation side in various places of rpm but in particular. In our consumer businesses. To address. Some inefficiencies that popped up both in the midst of the covid boom. And then the challenges that everybody faced with. You know supply chain issues. Just as a reminder. It was just the third quarter of this last fiscal year and january of this calendar year so december january. Do we have massive omicron disruptions. In our pleasant prairie plant in our kenosha distribution center those are. Are two largest facilities across all of our pm the largest fac. Consum. So it's. It's been pretty crazy so phil rates are up dramatically better but not where they need to be yet. We're working on. All right thanks very much. We have vincent andrews from morgan stanley. For next question. Thank you good morning congratulations on the congratulations on the results. I have a quick follow-up on that last question just as you know i know it's category captain you have good access. To what's going on in terms of retail takeaway so understanding what you said about the fill rates but are you making any progress. In terms of those store shelves or is the product still going out the door faster than you can get it on the shelf. I think we're making good. Progress on. A store shelves and i think you're you know again cross the industry. You're seeing. In comparison to prior year periods. Declines in the lotus single you know a mid-single digit. In terms of consumer takeaway so there is. Some weakness and some categories. At diy. I'm the flip side is on the. Pro area. So that is more in our primers and in our dab cox and sealants. You're actually seeing the opposite some low to mid single digit unit volume growth. Because the pro seems to be holding up pretty well. Of a diy is a takeaway is somewhat less than last year in recent periods is very volatile. And you can see one week to the next where. So you know that not feel rates but but consumer takeaway is up. And then a week later it's down. So there's a lot of volatility there in the diy space. But some pretty solid unit volume growth in in the. Pro contractor. And just as a follow-up you know you talked about the new management team. What what in particular they doing in the in the food coatings are additive space to sort of shake things up for you guys. I'm sure. Our metro's house or group which is part of the specialty products group. Is. Originally the business that created nature seal which was a patented product that that eliminated browning and sliced apples and so it really revolutionized. The apple market. And we rode a great profitability on that for a long time until it went off patton. So that was a challenge. We also acquired holton foods a couple other businesses that i don't recall off the top of my head two or three other businesses that. Relatively small a business called pfi. So they were. High margin food coating and or or. Specialty sustainable food additive businesses. And we had the leader retired of the mattress house or business three years ago. The head of pfi who actually was an owner who we bought the business from. Ran that business for a couple years we have worked together with him. To hire a really talented industry expert. Who is pulling those businesses together. On a more integrated. Basis in terms of our approach to the. And it's working. And they're they're doing a really nice job there there's some exciting product areas there's a product called vertigo. It's in testing. It is a coating for cardboard. That. Eliminate the need for plastic clam shells. So they have a lot of exciting things going on in that business. We've got a really talented industry expert that is now leading it. And pulling together what formerly were good but really independently operating. Businesses that were relatively small. Makes a lot of sense thanks for all the detail. Thank. We have. Bernie. Bank of america. Morning steve. You mentioned some consulting fees and so forth so what was a net earnings benefit of that. Perhaps more importantly. Is that a sustainable earnings contribution and subsequent quarters or was this more of a. One timer. And and i i'm sure you'll get into it more detail on friday. But. Can you highlight. Anything in particular. You know you implemented to achieve that $30 million in class savings. We will get into it in more detail on friday and and we've got some good slides that provide that detail and so. Don't want to get too much in front of that and that will be webcast all that information will be available to both those people present. As well as people that are online if you are present you also get a tour of our. A tremco sealant business and get to see their test law so we would encourage people to. Be here for that i think you'll get some really good insights. Into some unique things that we're doing in our construction products group. Specific to your question. We have been working without side consultants around. Big data management particularly as it relates to cost price mix. We have been working with folks in the. A consumer group. Better. Efficiencies in our manufacturing facilities and we are making good progress. It's particularly true rustoleum. Where we have. More purpose driven. Facilities around for instance large volume runs. Versus more specialty niche smaller runs. So there's a lot of areas that we are really focused on. And they all are areas that should be gifts that continue to keep on giving not one time. Items. The original map to growth program at key element of that was ms 168 which is our manufacturing systems 168. And introducing lean manufacturing disciplines. Those efforts did not end with the formal end. Of the 2020 map to growth program which was may 31 of 21 they are continuing. And that is giving us incremental benefits at the plant efficiency line as well so. And i guess the last time i would make is you know we have been developing. Getting to execute an app 2025 over the last year. We just kept waiting for the world to get more stable before we introduced and you know committed to. Some 3-year. Goals and i guess we decided that. You know we'd be waiting forever so we will and very excitedly. I introduce more detail on the map 2025 program on friday. Imprint any comment on on what they even contribution was from that it sounds like. You know whatever the cost associated with it has already been spent so perhaps. The margin benefit could expand from here. So it was 30 million dollars in q1. And again some of that is the result of the map 2025 initiatives. And some of that is a continuation of the original map program. Initiatives and. It will provide more detail and more guidance on what we expect. In the coming years and in some cases. For this year by quarter. If i can squeeze one more in here you mention. And of course account is is owned by tremco. It sounds like. Fixed costs associated with that plant. Or are not necessarily allocated to the other segments in a based on production is that right and does that. Does that not reducing incentives for. Cross segment collaboration. No we have a a formulaic cost plus. Approach to intercompany a manufacturing and coordination. And that's what's being applied here. But you know one of the great benefits of our map to growth program. Was the reorganization in the four segments and four groups. And being central lead in manufacturing in this lean. Manufacturing discipline discipline approach being center-led really to the point of centralized. In procurement. And the data that was required the data. Blake or data base that was required to allow that to happen. And so the collaboration and cooperation across rpms a hell of a lot better today than it ever was. And so your question i think sharply reflects following rpm for a long time and the fact that 10 years ago. That might have been a problem it's not a problem today. Thank you. If you have. We should not. From rbc capital market. Morning erin. Out on your line is open. Please go ahead okay i'm sorry i was asking a question. I was wondering can you guys hear me now. Yes yes we can okay. Having some technical sorry about that so real quick i was just wondering if you could help us understand again consumer was well above our estimates so. Looking at that segment if you could maybe split the the upside that you saw between maybe alcide resin availability improvement. Price cost and demand how would you kind of characterize how the segment performed. And your outlook i guess in those three buckets. Thanks. Sure. Pretty much the comments we made earlier. The a disproportionate share of our early map 2025 initiatives have been focused on consumer. Particularly in manufacturing effici. And so. You know we have picked up some manufacturing conversion cost efficiencies there. You'll recall a year ago that we talked about you know our gross margins were down in fiscal 22 and certain quarters by as much as a thousand bas. It's pretty dramatic. And we had talked about how hundreds of basis points of that. Was just poured throughput. Because of the. Material shortages because of some of the labor issues we faced. Show a combination of. Access to. Alcat resins. And we think we have a developed with corsicana maybe some better access to alka resins and some competitors. And a more normal throughput in our plants. Helped overhead cost absorption as well. And then certainly cost price mix. We got a higher. Price increases over the summer and consumer than we got over the summer and her other businesses cuz we were late. So again if you go back last year on a quarter by quarter basis you saw a really solid. Performance as we were gaining. Price in our industrial. Segment. And. And it took us. That typical 6 to 9 month lag. To be able to you know. Start to catch up on the cost price mix and consumer. And you saw that obviously in the first quarter. So those are the the primary drivers of our consumer business. We did have positive unit growth which in this environment is. Is not true at all consumer categories. I'm in some of that's the nature of our businesses relative to small project. Redecorating patch and repair. And maintenance. And i think some of it is catching up on. Some of the supply shortages and fill rate issues that we've been. Improving upon since last year. Great thanks and if i could just ask a quick follow-up so you've got it to looks like about 16% adjusted ebit margin in fiscal 25. Looks like over the last say 5 years you've been more in the 11 to 12% range so on an annual basis so it's a nice kind of $400 to 500 basis point uplift. You know of that improvement. Would you say that the the progress would be equally split between the segments. Or which segments do you see the greatest opportunity. And that move would it be radical over the period or would it be kind of you know back if waited or how do you think about that thanks. Sure so i can answer that from a big picture a perspective and then obviously we'll provide segment. Results when we release those and talk about them in january. I'm from a big picture perspective we made really good progress in our 2020 map to growth program. And we were a little bit behind the curve in terms of our goals. And then we got walloped by you know covid in the supply chain challenges and took a big step backwards that you saw in a results particularly. As volumes coming through our businesses and as we're catching up on cost price mix across all of our businesses. You are seeing us regain. Some of the map 2020 margin improvement. We obtained and is real. What was impacted by supply chain challenges. And as i indicated earlier the map 2025 program is been in the works. For a year and been in execution particularly with a focus on consumer starting in january. And so we're getting the benefit of that. That will continue throughout fiscal 23. We expect a positive sales in ebit results. In each of our four segments in the second quarter. But the volatility is such that beyond that i wouldn't say much about what you know further about our expectations other than. What will realize and then report in more detail on january. Okay thanks. Next question comes from josh spector ubs. Yeah good morning can you guys hear me. Yes. Okay great just. So just wanted to follow up on. Europe specifically within construction and performance. The driver's there are pretty different in terms of the customer buying patterns and i tend to think about performance at least. A little bit more length is kind of industrial capex maintenance spending so i don't know if you can comment if you've seen. That part of your market pull back equally. What you see on the construction side or if they've been more similar. And i kind of related to that. I mean most companies are talking about september got a lot worse versus august the prior couple months. Are you saying that as well and can you dimensionalize that versus the 8 and 1/2. Santa claus you reported this quarter. Sure so first of all. Europe was a challenge for all of our segments. In the quarter. Back and and we have a sizable presence there in consumer performance coatings and construction products. The biggest piece is construction products. I'm your observation is spot on. There are different dynamics and so. You know the construction products group underperformed our expectations. For the reasons we mentioned europe was a big piece of that. Showing a relative basis our performance coding screw while we struggled in europe there it was not nearly to the extent as our construction products group because of their end markets oil and gas. More industrial capital spending. And. I will tell you we expect in q2 and it is. Within our guidance. Continued negative. Performance in the top line and bottom line in the european marketplace. And. I don't know that it's going to be any different than what we experience in q1. But we are a little bit anxious about the winter months and you know what the. What it's going to look like when we get into the winter and then into the spring relative to the trajectory of the economy and its impact in europe. Okay maybe i could just try one other way to sign the the volume side i guess within europe i guess. If you're down 8 to 9% for the quarter. What was augustine meaningfully more so i guess we're volumes down there mid teens plus or was it more radical for you. Yeah. I don't know that we would want to get into talking about a month a particularly a month in our in our second quarter. But again i don't i think in q2 we would expect. A similarly disappointing or or deteriorated performance that we saw in q1. And so it's a combination of weak economic activity a meaningful contribution of it was the strong dollar and foreign exchange. So you know you're probably looking at a down 8 or 10%. In the top line and a down comparable to the i think. 30 you know operating earnings were down 30% i don't have you know we don't run. Ebit. And don't disclose even necessarily by. Geography but we thought it was important to highlight. Europe because it was a key factor. Across all of our businesses particularly in the construction products group in terms of. The challenges that we're facing and that's going to continue. At the same level. Okay appreciate it thanks. The next question comes from. Nicole. Jp morgan. Hi good. I think you said in the course of the call that your raw materials are up. 28%. But but in the q1 or raw materials were up 28% year over year and they were up about. Actually 2.6%. From quarter to quarter from q. For to q1 that they are increasing at a lower rate certainly than what we saw in q4 and q3 but they're still up here over here. So i was puzzled by that because. Your cost of goods sold is up 14 and 1/2 %. And even if you take your map to growth. 30 mill. And you add that back. Then cost of goods sold is up 18. So how can raw materials be up 28. If cost of goods sold is only. I would have to do the the math and and get back to you you know. Our cost of goods sold incorporate. That that's basically our chemical cost of goods sold and incorporates a freight and incorporates. Other issues so i don't have a specific answer to you other than. You know we did the calculation on our. Primary. Raw material chemicals and they're up 20%. And then in the in the year over year quarter. Your stna was. I don't know 57. How would you divide that among the different segments was the. Was there any stna grow. In. Consumer business was that kind of flat. And did volumes grow year over year in consumer. Show volume screw every in each segment except for especially products group year over year. And. The stna was. Relatively equal across all of our businesses you know we don't disclose that level of detail. But they were consistent with a year ago i think that the thing that's benefited us during the map to growth program and quite honestly through covid. Is there was a level of. Covid driven. Reductions in sg&a around traveling entertainment and other things. And through the benefits of map to growth and also understanding. Certain covid impacted expenses what was essential and continuing so for instance. We are again doing major sales meetings. Across most of our major businesses. Those were expenses we did not incur for the two years of 20 and 21 during october that we are recurring those. But the level of t&e is at a lower level. That was pre-cov. And so. I guess those are the comments i would have but there's really nothing extraordinary and sg&a. I'm sweet we are building a sebastian a. Talent if you will in our special products group. And we are also building a semest gna in our carboline business. And in both cases to address either opportunities. For grow. Our specifically with carboline. To be more deliberate about expanding their base of business outside of their traditional oil and gas markets which is really what where they exceed. Part of what's driving our performance coding group today. So we have a number of growth initiatives subscribing sgna. Nothing out of the ordinary. And then lastly you know interest rates are going up in the united states. It is that making a difference to your demand profile and. Construction products. Interstate that. Your order level is changed at all or as far as your concerned interest rates really aren't making much of a difference at all and going up. Yeah it's it's a great question. We have some exposure to. Housing market now with new dora and and so. Maybe our housing market exposure is a couple hundred million dollars. And we didn't have much of it before in total. So that certainly somewhat interest rate sensitive. But we had solid organic growth in our construction products group the united states. And it's an interesting dynamic jeff relative to. The types of things that normally you would have looked at historically. In recessionary period it would be driving activity. And quite honestly the fact that cities counties and states are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars. That have to be purposed. From various stimulus. And so the institutional work that we're doing with schools or hospitals. And the infrastructure work is still pretty solid. And. You know if the dynamics around all the stimulus is true. That should remain true in the united states for the another year and a half or two years. And you can't even see. The benefits yet of the trillion dollar plus infrastructure bill that was passed. So they're just some funny dynamics. In this economy that don't fit. With the normal type of indicators that you would have looked at in the past. Okay great thank you so much. Thank you. The next question comes from. Ben trump punjabi. Bird. Morning handsome. Good morning can you hear me. Yes. Thank you. Okay great. I guess just as related to follow up to the last question you know the consumer in the us and. Definitely absorbing a fair amount of inflation. Some categories that are. Jim staples i should start to show some signs of fun destruction as he left. Electricity sort. Unfold. How do you see that dynamic playing out for your consumer segment. Next couple of quarters i realize. From drill availability is improve. But what about the demand. Sure so in general i think we're seeing demand destruction in europe and that's obvious for my results and we expect that to continue and we're concerned that it could get worse in the winter relative to. Energy issues in the russian war in ukrain. In the us in particular as i commented earlier. You know consumer takeaway. It has been. Volatile. From one week to the next it's up 3 or 5%. Another week it might be down 5 or 10%. So it's it's very volatile in terms of of where consumer spending is. I think we're doing better than other than other kind of diy categories because of the diy small project paint patch repair. Maintenance aspect of our products. And. Also the kind of catch up. I'm on the poor fill rate. Situation that we experienced in. The back half of physical 21 in a good part of fiscal 22 so that's improving. We are seeing and this is broadly. Inventory adjustments at all the big. A big accounts. And again so there's a lot of dynamics going on here inventory adjustments. Still rates improving. Volatile consumer takeaway. Is making for a very interesting dynamic and so. I think that's why we're. Very confident in the forecast that we provided for q2. But are still in. The the business of forecasting quarter by quarter. Because to go out further than that is really impossible. That we're struggling with that as well for the second question you know on your comment i think you said that wrong drills were a roughly. Percent or just. How do you sort of see that evolving you know. Took you on words. And i'm asking because you know. It seems like there could. Decor. Between europe which is dealing with the energy prices. Signific. To the u. If that. Can you confirm that. And then second are you fully caught up on price. Each of the operating segment. So i'll answer the last part the answer is no you know we were fully caught up in a number of our industrial businesses. And then i think. You know people were expecting particularly with some of the underlying. Primary chemicals coming down that we'd see a flattening out. And so in our construction products group in a few instances were behind the curve because of continuing inflation. Q1. We're getting there in consumer. And again that's more related to the lag that you know we the people are aware of that has been true for us forever. And. And so that. I think that's an issue. We did have $30 million dollars of benefit from the map 25 program at q1. And we will provide more detail. Car expectations when we when we talk in our investor day. On friday. Including over the map 2025 program. Some anticipation of a. You know improving in the commodity cycle. Which should benefit our margins. That's anybody's guess but the current underlying. Lower levels of. Propylene and and polyethylene and ethylene and some of the primary. Chemicals which are down. But have not. Translated into lower. The prices of the type of special chemicals we buy yet. Are things that we'll talk about on friday and i think things that we anticipate. I should benefit margin recovery over the map 2025 program but the world we're living in today is still inflationary you know the the. The situation in q1 is. Maybe surprising to some of our businesses but. It's the world we live in. Got it thanks so much. Thank you. All right. A next. Comes from the line of kevin mccarty. From vertical research partners. Morning kevin good morning. Can you hear me okay. Yes thank you. Excellent i wanted to talk. Pricing little bit frank. She referenced the raw material. Cost increase of. 6% on a quarter to quarter basis. You in that context are you continuing to seek incremental pricing at the stage of the cycle and and if so. Where are you most encouraged or lease encourage by prospects there and if i zoom out the lens do you think that you know very impressive level of 15% that you realized in the first quarter. Can be sustained for a little while here or do you think the comps just get too tough and and therefore the price contribution starts to come down. I'm sure so i think i think we'll have. Solid contributions from price and q2. It will start you know the benefit of price across rpm. Will start to do you know it'll still be positive but start to deteriorate in q3 and q4 as we annualize price increase actions that our companies took. In fiscal. 22. And so and then. Unless there are further price increases which would be in response to further inflation. I think we round the annualizing of pretty much all of our price increases. By the first quarter of next year. And so you'll see the impact slowly diminish. After q2. But still be positive and. That that assumes that things stay stable as to where they are now. Okay that that's very helpful. I don't want to ask about your legend brands business i think you referenced. Hurricane ian and some of the heroic efforts that rpm folks have been engaged in. In recent days. Can you put that event in. Versus history you know if i look back to winter storm yuri or hurricane harvey. How how do these disasters tend to flow through the financials for that business. Sure so first of all physical 22 is a particularly challenging in the back half of 21 time for legend brands. They're oddly because they're in the equipment business in overtime and developed very sophisticated equipment that could be controlled remotely. We're impacted by the chip shortage. And so that was an issue. And there really wasn't much in the way of. A hurricane activity or. A challenges in. A calendar. 21 or in our physical 22. It's certainly possible that an event like ian could drive. 10 million plus. Of a spiky. Revenue clim. With pretty decent margin business. Over a call and a quarter and a half or two quarter period. So intense you know that the response here is certainly going to be greater than zero. You know could be 10 million plus. And it happens over i'll call the three or four month period. But it's not a sustained increase. We've grown that business nicely since we bought it. They are selling their products into different channels. I'm looking at some new product introductions. Those are the kind of things that lead to a steady increase on a business that's roughly $140 million bucks. And then you can see these 10 or 15 million. Event related spikes over time. Got it thank you very much. The next question. From the lineup for. From wells fargo. Morning michael. Great this is richard on for mike. Hey richard. What one question on. Just maybe you can give some color on the commercial construction market. Apple said now how it's impact is on cpg and. Tcg segment. And then maybe just. Give us an outlook. He mentioned. Do the restoring benefits. But you should see maybe also just disability and hot the lead time that you. You get on that as well. So our performance coding screw is. More driven by heavy industry so oil and gas. Marine wastewater water treatment things like that. And that business from a demand perspective is doing very well. That's globally as well as in north america. And see that continuing because the stimulus dollars i referenced and where they'll go and the infrastructure dollars that are coming. And beyond shoring we do a lot of fab plants around the globe. With our stone heart flooring business. Would you a lot of international fire coatings. One of the interesting thing is we had some interesting. Big projects in the last year. A test of plan expansion some intel expansions. They were difficult to supply because of. Raw material shortages the raw material shortages that impacted that are behind us for now hopefully permanently. So we're pretty bullish on. The performance coding group dynamics for the foreseeable future. Construction products is. Related to the things i talked about earlier there are just. Conflicting demand signals europe is a problem for our construction products group and that will continue. North america has been really solid both some cost price mixed recovery. Good unify and growth. But we saw these unexpected we think circumstantial situations around concrete supply for instance. In canada. Just a interesting a challenge right now we are generating. Positive uniform growth and and some additional price benefit on top of that. Although she saw in the quarter not enough. To get us back to record eva margin. Those things combined with the benefits of map 2025. We would expect we'll drive. Positive event results year over year and in all of our segments including. Our construction product segment in q2. Okay great thanks. Thank you. Did i know for the. I would like. Rpm chairman. Executive officer frank. Thank you waseem and thank you everybody for your participation in our call today.
