We ask that you limit yourself to one question and then get back in the queue please. With that i will turn the call over to miguel miguel please go ahead. Thank you n. Before discussing the business more broadly let me begin with a brief discussion of our latest acquisition. A controlling interest in bebo one of the largest suppliers are propagated vegetables and ornamental plants in north america. This transaction first and foremost underscore is a discipline approach to capital allocation. And second is consistent with both our immediate needs and our vision of becoming a leader in global cannabis. That will be managed by its existing management team who have over 85 years of agricultural experience. And i've consistently demonstrated growth and revenue and earnings over the past decade. Likely they're retain a substantial equity ownership position as they embark on a robust growth. It's part of the transaction we have identified a profitable opportunity to repurpose the worst guy facility. Cultivation and vegetable propagation with minimal capital investment. This will greatly increase by those production capability. And extended shipping range in canada and the united states. You also enable us to generate incremental revenue and adjusted ev. While saving on previously announced wine down and selling costs. The transaction is immediately a creative to auror. Adding approximately 9 million annual adjusted evita. An importantly is another tangible step towards our goal of adjusted even a profitability. On the runway bas. By december the 31st 2022. We are pleased that bellows our partner. Expect our investment to drive significant shareholder value over the long. Beyond position we feel very good about our position in the market. Or optimism is based on the inherent strength of our global medical cannabis business. Will remain the number one canadian lp. Medical cannabis remains the best segment to invest. As is both defensive and stable in terminal. And commands amiable adjusted gross mar. The consistently feed 60%. Two times that the consumer cannabis. And while our canadian medical cannabis business is steady. Our international business so revenues increase by over 70% this pistol year. With notable progress. Germany. The uk and australia. The second reason for our enthusiasm is we continue to excel at rationalizing the business to the current environment. As you know our annualized cost savings of 150 to 170 million. Will be completed within the next two quarters. And once complete. For materially reduce our cash. And get us closer to even a break even. A balance sheet is also a key differentiator and is enabled us to repurchase 155 million in convertible debt during q4. Which will result in considerable savings on cash interest costs. Additionally we have approximately 370 million in cash as of yesterday. Which makes aurora one of only a handful of companies within the cannabis industry. Do you have a net cash position. Finally we feel great about our investment in science. Which is beginning to pay off. Specifically our breeding program. Has delivered nine new proprietary cultivar. To our product pipeline since june of 2021. Delivered meaningful improvement to yield. And is expected to generate incremental. Hi margin revenue through license agreements for the genetic innovations. The other license producers. In fact i'm excited to announce that we signed our first group agreement to license genetics to a major canadian lp during q4 and we expect more to follow. Let's take a deeper dive into our global medical cannabis business. During q4 international medical revenue was up 35% compared to last year. As our regulatory expertise. Compliance protocol. Testing and science capabilities supported our leadership position. Well revenue contributions for individual countries can certainly have been flow as these new markets develop. Do the various factors including the timing of government approvals and import permit. We believe our exposure to nearly a dozen countries outside of canada before just relative insulation. As it relates to the economic climate and conditions in specific countries across europe. Israel. An australia. In poland rebel news nearly doubled year over year and we maintained our number one market share position. We continue to invest in marketing efforts there to support our plan launch of new flower and extract products. In the uk are revenues increased by 25% compared to q4 last year. We believe with the market leader in the flower se. Uk witness rapid growth and patient population over the last year. And we hope to see this continuous new clinics open up. Turning to germany we received eu gmp certification for our state-of-the-art domestic medical cannabis production facility in may. And made our first shipment to german pharmacies that same month. We'll call that we hold one of only three licenses in germany. And our number two in medical flower with a 17% volume share. Our market share is also growing steadily in the extract market thanks to new product innovation. During q4 we also launched three sizes of tramadol. Maybe our first step into that category. Well growth in. Year germany remains the largest market in the eu on 83 million citizens. But only about 100 to 120,000 medical cannabis patients. We are certainly well aware of somebody economic challenges that germany is facing that the present time. There's a grapples with the war in uk. And the impact that is having an energy prices and inflation. Still we are hopeful to growth will pick back up this fiscal year even against this backdr. Driven by doctor education and a simplified reimbursement process. We expect to begin generating revenues in france in 2023. We are currently the only supplier of dry flower in the pilot program. Finally in australia are 24 revenue rose 700%. You're over. Driven by record number of patients. Let me reiterate that we believe that cannabis growth story will center on international medical and recreational over the next several years. Right now we believe there are about 150,000 pat. In europe alone. And if the countries that have so far legalized medical cannab. Would you read similar adoption levels to canada. 1% of the adult population. The piercing pool can expand to 3.5 million people. This fiscal year we expect the number of new medical markets to come online. And several governments have announced plans for recreational schemes. Most notably germany so it's a massive opportunity. We believe our success in medical cannabis provides us with a significant first mover advantage. And our leadership will be portable to rec markets as they open up. Turning to the canadian medical market are leading market share was over 24% will insured patients comprise 81% of our domestic medical sales. Open 79% in q3. Are not revenue per order and per participating patient and both significantly increased over the past year. Dude was shift towards higher value and shirt pat. Or direct to consumer approach continues to drive industry leading margin. Overall revenue was flat and q4 compared to q3 but we attribute our share game to the best in class service we offer. Along with new premium products and innovations. We know that acquiring retaining and moving the patient through the process. Requires significant resources and experience. And much of that same infrastructure and know how a patience in canada. Is directly applicable to our success in europe. Switching the canadian adult wreck are q4 revenue will increase by 2.3 million dollars. As compared to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to our strength and product offerings in certain categories. Along with 7 weeks the results from thrive. The premium consumer cannabis net revenue added about 1.4 million. Body environment of canadian rack is soon for long macro challenges we are beginning to see signs of stabilization. We remain focused on maximizing profitability. Through low cost production and by entering higher margin categories. The market also continues to highlight the importance of innovation and moscue life cycle. The typical sku generating 80% of its lifetime value in the 6 months following launch. 13 skews were launched across a rack and medical channels in june alone and we have a stacked pipeline that should service well over the coming quarters. More broadly we believe that our scientific leadership and cannabis breeding and genetics provides a roar with a unique advantage. It drives value in all tears of the consumer and medical categories. Are breeding program is delivered nine new proprietary cultivars to our product pipeline since june of 2021. As well as bringing new products to consumers. They deliver meaningful improvements in yield. Which will allow us to boost top quality. For example are you farm gas called the bar delivers nearly double the yields of our traditional staple cultivar. And does so in an average of 26.5% thc. With that i would now like to turn the call over to glen for a financial review. Let me quickly say that we've made incredible strategic progress during the year. We are on track with our transformation plan and we feel very optimistic about the future of the business. Text miguel. Good afternoon everyone. We're proud of one of the strongest balance sheets among canadian lps and i'm pleased that we strengthened it even further during q4. But the same time that we've been executing our cost reduction plan. We also repurchased $155.3 million in principal on your convertible. The total cost of $149.2 million in cash. That's including a crude interest. As of yesterday we had approximately 370 million dollars canadian of available cash. And we have 209 million us principal remaining on a convertible. We believe that debt reduction even though maturity is still more than a year out. Is it smart and defensive capital allocation decision that reduces balance sheet risk. Especially important during turbulent markets. If the debt reduction activated so far saving us cash interest cost at 9.5 million dollars ann. Continue to have access to shelf perspectives. 713.7 million dollars us still available. Including 186.2 million dollars us remaining under our atm program. Between me utilize from time to time for strategic purp. Cash flow continues to improve. With 22.5 million dollars used in operations in working capital in q4. Compared to 39.3 million dollars in fire quarter. 24 includes restructuring and severance payments of 6.8 million dollars. Removing closer to a positive adjustable. As we reduced our loss by 8.9 million. Last year. If we compare the last quarter to. Adjust to deep at the loss increased by about 1.5 million. And that's driven mostly by a change in the. Sales channel. As miguel mentioned we also expect a positive contribution from our controlling stake and bevel. Which delivered either 9 million dollars for the year and they. 2022. I should note that the devil business has a strong seasonal cadence with the period from january to june. Expected to deliver roughly 2/3 of the full annual revenue. The overall ferrari remains on track to achieve a positive a positive adjusted either. As we execute. Q4 that cannabis reviews 50.2 million. Not compared to 50.4 million size quarter. Routine 1 million dollar provision for returns from part period so excluding that prayer period adjustment. Rodney was 51.2 million. Medical cannabis fell modestly while consumer cannabis rose. You're mostly the contribution from a thrive. Let me know address each of our core businesses in a bit more. Navy medical revenue was 24.9 million dollars in. 118,000 from q3. And reflecting the stability of this business. Our focus and traction with the insured patient population is certainly beneficial to us. It provides greater consistency to the segment in antioconomic environment. Well the higher marginally for this business compared to the consumer cannabis business contribute substantially more to our bottom line. International medical revenue is 11.6 million dollars and i reflected 35%. Versus the same quarter you. The 20% decrease sequentially. Increase compared to q4 last year was due to our strong presence and key international growth markets including australia poland in the uk. The decrease relative to last quarter. Resulted from a temporary situation of limited supply of high demand cucumbers in europe. Coupled with a weekend. We expect the supply issues to continue through t1. But to improve in the following quarters. Taken together are leaving canadian and global medical business performed well. Generating 36.6 million in sales. An adjusted gross margins of 62%. Down only slightly from 64% the prior quarter. Medical representative of 73% of our 24 revenue. And about 86% of our adjusted gross profit. This segment best distinguishes us from our comp. And is critical. Aurora's path to deliver positive adjusted deep into run rate as we access december 202. Thank you for consumer of me was 12.6 million. A 2.3 million dollar increase compared to last quarter. Consumer cannabis representative of 27% of our 24 revenue and about 14% of our. Revenue increase would do mailing to 1.4 million from the addition of fries consumer business starting may 6th. And the relative stabilization of. Canadian consumer business. Now that being said we do expect some short-term disruptions to q1 consumer cannabis revenue due to the cyber attack on the ontario cannabis store distribution system. In a significant labor strike at bc's liquor and cannabis distribution centers. Is our revenue exposure from these events being as much as $3 million dollars in key. We do not expect this to impact your timelines to prof. As i just mentioned her medical business is responsible for about 86% of our adjusted gross prof. Sg&a which includes r&d came in at 49.3 million dollars into. However this included 6.7 million dollars in restructuring cost. And 2.3 million dollars in car. Employee related to pro. This restructuring related to the significant staffing reductions we took in june 2022. As part of our business in class transformation. Excluding these cost 249.1 million. This is our lowest level of estine animals for years. Ultimately we expect to drive us tonight for the existing cannabis business to below 30 million. The meaningful reduction expected into one. And the full savings being realized by december 2022. They're pulling all of this together. We generated an adjustable loss in 24 2022 of 12.99. American 11.4 million dollars in previous quarter. It's driven mostly by changing the company salesman so more consumer revenue and sales in q4 which. Yelled at lower average net selling. Looking forward into q1 physical 2023 we do expect to see an improvement to adjust it. But that will be driven primarily by a reduction in sg&e to under 35 million. I would like to reiterate our commitment to annualized cost savings $150-170 mill. Be savings or evenly split between costs to get sold and asking anywhere you're seeing them reflected in our p&l. University occur for the afternoon savings or is inventory is gone down with production related. Is the decisions were taken you're working toward a leader or agile operating. Not as expected to provide strong even delivered his future revenues. Thank you for we also recognize non-cash impairment charges of $505.1 million. This is relating to goodwill and the last that's another 10 to. Impairment represents the full remaining goodwill balance associated with aurora cannabis operations. And the impairment was partially due to changes in cannabis market conditions but most importantly. Changes in the current capital market environment including higher rates of borrow. Lower foreign exchange. I finally just a minor housekeeping item. Are upcoming fiscal year 2023 well only have three quarters is we're changing our fiscal year end to march 31st and that's in order to achieve certain internal cost and staffing effici. To conclude there are three key points for my financial review that i'd like to read. First or balance sheet is stronger than ever. Supported by a healthy cash balance. Release convertible debt level. Improving working capital and cash flow. Medical businesses in canada and globally provide us with a competitive advantage and are critical to. Generating sustainable profit. And finally we've taken the actions to meet our target. Precautions but september 2022. People have a materially positive impact on our bottom line. Reflect a linear operating model of physicians as well for. So thanks for your interest in aurora and i'll now turn the call back to mig. Thanks gl. Cure for brief takeaways before we take your questions. We're better position than ever to achieve our goal of a positive adjustment even a run. Cuz we acted the quarter in december of 2022. We have listed out several data points and support that here today. To our medical cannabis business is a formidable force in the industry both domestically and internationally. It remains the smartest cannabis segment to a best behind today. Given the long-term growth opportunities the high margin. Family defensive nature of the segment described earlier. The canadian rack market is in the process of correcting and as you as the recovery is complete. We will have added opportunity for market share and pricing. For science and innovation program represents another high margin opportunity that's just started. To conclude we're making significant strategic progress with each passing quarter we're nearing the completion of our business transformation plan and have done so while strengthening our balance sheet. In addition we made two acquisitions in the past few months. Ride and then double. Which underscores our ability to grow organically. Andrew roman. Can you feel confident that we can create significant. Long-term shoulder value particularly news levels. We appreciate your time and interest in aurora and i'll be happy to take your questions. Operator please open the lines for questions. Hey can i get this time we'll be conducting a question and answer. If you like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone. A confirmation call will indicate your line isn't the questions. Before press. That are currently in the question queue to please limit yourself to only one question. Anger with cowan. Beautiful see what your. Hi good evening. So i just wanted to dig on dig into some of the the revenue versus volume dynamics that you guys experienced in the quarter. Maybe it's a simple as fx headwinds which were very familiar with covering you know large cap staples but usually your your revenues and volumes at least directionally move in tandem and it seems like there was a bit of a divergence there so i'm wondering if there's any. Geographic mix or other price mix considerations to call out please thank you. Yeah i think what we saw was a bit of a mixed change between consumer and medical or are european medical. They did take a step down in the quarter a particularly in germany and there's a cultivar. Producing the range of reproduction problems they are correctable they're in protests being corrected but. So what we then saw if you're looking our average price or something it is that consumer particularly with the addition of. Verizon stock is. You know they did greater impact from the consumer pricing that we normally see in the mix. So that might be what you're looking at but other than that i think. In the business as usual in terms of volume. You get that that impact from you know more. On the consumer business in. Okay thank you. Our next question comes from the line. Michael every with piper sand. Thank you good evening. Just wanted to understand some of your thinking on the portfolio strategy a little bit more the. The greenhouse synergies with with vivo makes sense and take advantage of just your particular situation and obviously had. You know how bad some evita but. Are there any other jason sees you'd be considering or that are on your radar or. Your legacy is one part of it and maybe related is just also. As you think about the the evita target it is any more expected to come from m&a. Yeah i mean so let me. Try to unpack that a little bit. I think as it pertains to m&a. Our center of the plate or where we sort of live is you know medical cannabis global medical cannabis and so for that reason. Certain things that you know have been of interest to others are probably not as much of interest to. Our position on the us. I think it's one that's been validated it's going to take longer i'm of the strong belief that it's going to be if it's federal it's going to be a medical construct or the fda involved. And clearly given our you know dominance internationally on medical cannabis would have a lot of options there. So if you take the us out of the max and you take maybe some other things out of the. You find certain things that maybe are more attractive to us than others we. You know thrive and we talked about that because of the management team and the ability to really. Support what i think is important synergies between rock and medical. Devil we think is just an absolute you know diamond rough but. Credible. You know propagator science has a really clever use. A tax benefits as it pertains to sky. And has a big upside of growth for what we thought was a fair value both for us and for their shareholders so yeah i think michael will continue to look at things like that we've been terribly patient. It was gladden was pretty eloquent about the balance sheet it's importantly that we have a really strong balance sheet so we're not going to chase there but if things come up we we've got you know the fire power to go after him the only other place that that maybe you know is of more interest to someone like us could maybe others are those things that connect into medical cannabis. You know it's my opinion and i think it's been proven out. That you can make investments. Around medical cannabis and those investments in some cases are portable around the world. You know infrastructure systems. Understandings around patience and science. Which now is something we've made a lot of investments in there now we're just starting to pay dividends we go. You know i i think we're pretty good shape in terms of the you know the part. You know the reality is. You know if we can hold revenues and margins flap in the current level and we can get sga under 30. You know you got there and so you know we expect to read that reach that type of sg&a like you too and we've shown a lot of progress and i think. While some you know may have other questions when we said we're going to do something around efficiencies we've done it and you know that as teenager clearly be consistent with that. Okay really helpful thank you. Thank you michael. Our next question comes from the line of pablo zlan. Cancer fitzger. Thank you afternoon miguel you know i'm looking at a press release at till rate issue on september 6. Princess attila initiates round table with german regulator. Turkey grove legislation to legalize. I'm wondering when i saw a press release i said well i mean i suppose that aurora will. Which one is your similar. So i guess the question the very basic question is. Can you tell us or give some color. About your loving capabilities. Your people on the ground. Your potential seat at the table. In in helping draft the german program because again i was surprised still issue a press release and we didn't hear from. I need a favor question. Where do you guys stand today in terms of weather germany will allow imports or it's going to be initially mostly just domestic production. You got. So the first thing is i'm not here to comment on anybody i have tremendous respect for my competitors and you know. And what they do is is what what they do but i'm so i really have any comment on that terms of the german market you know we've made a significant investment in germany we have what we think. Might be one of the leading government relations government affairs executives in germany. He is you know having good conversations with the regulators. I spent my whole career you know working on things like this in both tobacco and alcohol and they're never a straight line. I think as it pertains to germany there's two things going on as you well know and you've written a lot about. Is both enhancement. On to the medical business which were very excited about is where the leaders in medical cannabis in germany and secondly is the the legalization that the recession so. My understanding and i understanding is that industries you know what industry needs in order for that to be successful is being considered the german government is then almost always are being very thoughtful. About the stakeholders and the timing in which you know this can be done in a compliant way i would expect they're learning from medical will color. Are they so go about you know the implementation of breakfast which is why we think those companies that you know have. Facilities. With the medical business will have advantages in rack and is you know we said earlier one of only three companies that have a license to produce in german. In country. You know the i think the going in position i think for most folks should be that because of the you know the un conventions and just because of the way the rags are going to work. Or. Is that you know the. Obvious path. For rack would be in country manufacturing. Now clearly whether the number is 200 times or 300 times or 400 times in order to service that rack market that is simply more capacity than the three of us have. But clearly that would be you know an opportunity there. We've also would say that while rack most likely would be an in-country. A production exercise medical continues to be allowed. With an eu gmp certification to have products brought into germany we do that successfully today from both our nordic facility as well as our canadian facilities. We think it's one of our core companies so more to follow in germany i understand the interest in it. You know i think what i would tell people is it's going to move thoughtfully it might not always be a straight line. But we've had tremendous respect for the regulators they are in what we've seen from the medical business and i think you know my expectation is. That you know it will be a robust rock business i just can't predict when but at the time it will be. Compliant companies. Experience companies and thoughtful companies will have an advantage in germany and then clearly you have germany implements this that will be a beacon for other key markets around the world in terms of how you can go for medical cannabis and recreational campus. Thank you. You got it. Our next question comes from the line of andrew carter with. People see what your question. We certainly have experience with you know covering site one. Number one do you see this platform to go deeper in this given this that this is a you know this is a very fragmented space and you know how the team to run that. And then the second you have the decision to repurpose sky. Versus selling it which that's an opportunity cost that if you will kind of ask the cost acquisition. What kind of timeline are you giving the bevo team to get this up to speed cheaper return. Versus if it didn't go well kind of returning to that original selling the facility and also getting rid of all the costs associ. Thanks. You got andrew so first on bevo bello is a tremendous business and you guys did cover it and so did others. I think it is it is a fallacy to say that bebo. Didn't work in that previous contract when it was connected to another cannabis company. Double did work it just that combination did not work we are not combining bebo. Where the aurora from cannabis assets and on canvas assets so there's that. Secondly you know bubba is a tremendous. Business they have significant big box contracts both in canada and us. And there is a lot of opportunity right now. In north america for them to expand that business both in canada and the us. Because of shipping costs and many of the items that they produce. Are produced offshore in asia and southeast asia. And so they have tremendous opportunities there and we're excited about that. Particularly since it can be done in a very capitalized manner it's not going to you know draw down cash resources from an award it would expand that and the team that has so successfully run it is going to continue to run it this is not a word is not pretend. They have excellence in an orchids are propagation so it was key for us to have those. Key fox over there to run it and we're thrilled about that. As it pertains to sky you know. I don't want. Get you popped up about this but the combination of the tax benefit. The repurposing. The changes in the tax designation and the upside that it presents very quickly. Fort belvo was a way better deal. Then being caught up with everybody else trying to sell cannabis. And at the end of the day. If they can't get there. We can always be a salad in that key edmonton market. But the beauty you know if there is such a thing of all the money that's been spent on skies there's not a lot of capex or apex required by bebo in order to generate revenue so you know glenn mentioned the battle of business is a seasonal and contributes more. In our q2q3 than it doesn't q1 but the answer your question i think we'll know in the you know i'm saying next 9 to 12 month. Exactly what sky means for bebo. And you know. If it doesn't work out we still have that optionality but the offset of all the things i've mentioned. Make that. Significantly a better advantage for aurora than you know just selling it for pennies on the dollar. Thanks i'll pass on. You very welcome thank you. And our next question comes from the line of andrew bond with. People see with your question. Hey good evening andrew bond in line for owen bennett thank you for taking our question. So for my son on the international segment. Could you give some more detail on performance between markets not looking for an exact breakout but i think last earnings call y'all discussed. Plans to launch extracts in the uk in 4q and then also some top market share positions in the other key markets like australia and germany poland so. Any detail on where sales came from in 4q and and where there might have been some weakness relative to 3q. And if i could just sneak in maybe more broadly how you would characterize growth ahead and fiscal 23 thank you. Charlotte let me take a top line comment about international and some of those key markets in la glen get into some of the details about it. Joke you know as we said not prepared remark. It is really important to be operating in you know a lot of countries. And so the reason for that. Is the sales are still a bit lumpy we've all seen that in and what's happened with israel. But whether it's import permits or shipments or the reg sort of evolving you get these sort of months where you know have your sales and get this month you don't. Secondly a lot of these investment. Can play out and really generate incremental margins and revenue. If they're laid over a broader system. So the same production system the same cultivars the same genetics the same a lot of things are similar to what we do in germany czech republic pollen on and on and on. You have to have different distribution models to take advantage of those different pieces and we've done that and so in most markets we're just the manufacturer but another markets we have a sales force and a wholesale piece. The western european or the international market as a whole. Is absolutely growing and clearly is the fastest growing segment of global candidates which is this medical piece and i will say that the rags are quite similar. Whether that's packaging stability testing manufacturing eugmp there is been the sort of consistency and evolution that advantages. The company like us now in terms of the actual specifics on the country breakouts glen alternate over to you. Yeah thanks so i mean we keep calling out the same countries as it's kind of the dominant ones for us in our in our network and that's germany poland uk. In australia but miguel's point they definitely are lumpy like australia for instance in case where was up 75% from the previous quarter. But then they like a cute one okay it'll come down again and keep you look looks good again but it's very important to have that portfolio because for the most part are international business. It's fairly predictable but country by country you know as they develop and. And you know as if they find you know where those. Barriers are that need to be knocked down patient access things like that and that was definitely the story in australia year to back. When they happen to improve patient accessibility in the market seems to be a really kind of taking. Dreams of our extract in germany did launch and q4 late and q4 so we don't see much in terms of revenue in germany into. But it is important part of the competitive landscape there so we are in that market now. Animal report more. To go forward. On how that piece of our business is going for game germany australia uk poland being the predominant international medical markets for us right now. But i'd say there's probably. Contributing re. Got it thanks glenn thanks for go appreciate it i'll pass it on. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of. Matt adam lee with can of cord you can see what your question. Good evening everyone thanks for taking these questions just two questions for me on on the revenue side of things. First just on the consumer sales in canada there's a bit of a divergence i think was noted. With respect to aurora cells relative to the macro level data on some of these point of sale subscription services we all look like so glenn you had mentioned some of the headwinds related to maybe the ocs website or some other so i'm just wondering if you can give us a little more color on that and the second question on revenue is just related to your international sales is the current 11 to 12 million that you did in q4 if that just stays flat for the sake of argument is that sufficient to get you to your profitability targets on an adjusted considering a lot of your margins does come from those cells. One of the gap. And some of the syndicated data that everybody looks at is quebec quebec is our largest province in terms of sales. And so is it underweights you know what we're doing i think generally. The rock business overall for an lp is generally challenging you know it was reference before what happened with the hack unfortunately in the ocs. That caused about 2 weeks of disruption they did an unbelievable job to get back up and running. We also saw the strike out in bc that had a pretty significant effect for a long period of time that's been cleaned up as well. Leave the combination of that and retail stores. Feeling a lot of pressure plus compressed margins you know overall means you really have to be sort of. Focused in where we went and the thrive team center tremendous job and you can still there's some places you can find to make money. You know premium flower obviously but babe's concentrates and some of the other things that they're particularly good at. So i think you know we're going to be in this wash a little bit longer. In terms of what the macro sort of you know issues are with rack but when it comes out. You know there is tremendous amount of efficiencies for someone that does. As well as we do in medical and rack to have some of those items particularly as patients are starting to look for more premium items. I'm in clinicians are starting to be more open to var. So glad you pick up the rest of it. Would be more than adequate to get us to our profitability goal if you certainly picking up the message that. Most of our our gross profit is being generated over medical businesses so 86% in q4 and that was a quarter where. Where international medical a little bit of a pause so. Yeah normal the quarter before say to three was 90% of her gross profits were coming out of our medical system so absolutely as we see. Don't grow picking up the game and you're up in australia over the next number of quarters if it's a canadian business objective is to stabilize it. I'm getting on good footing and give it a get the launchpad for growth in the future but the short term. Plan is to really get to our profitability go on the back of our medical business. Appreciate all that thanks guys. Our next question comes from the line of. But rico gomez with atp capital market. People see with your. Hi good evening yeah thanks for taking my my questions. Yeah on the international side. Increase competition some markets no mainly israel i know several other lps and international companies exporting to different markets. So can you talk about how you see that that competition coming. I know are you seeing any any marching pressure in international and what sort of advantage do you have to compete you know your main markets like germany and. Thank you. Sure so you know listen i spent a lot of time in israel and israel is obviously of you know a key market for a lot of fol. The challenges we talked about in israel is they have a significant amount of local production. And clearly. United manager so the import permits and the process. I'm your certification of israel is sort of an evolving one what we've said. You know about that is that we're not going to give him forward looking guidance on israel but when we have a shipment. We always let people know because of the size of it i'm not. You know we haven't had a shipment in the bed on israel i don't think that's a forever situation but you know right now it's not as big a focus because into your point there has been a little bit of margin compression and a lot of people are fighting for that including the local growers that have a lot of advantages. I've got tremendous respect for that. Overall internationally because of the medical setup we haven't seen the type of margin compression that you've seen. You know in the canadian breakfast or in the us. Overall. And these are really hard markets to get into. Yeah germany which everybody talks about. Is about a 6 or 12 month process in order to even qualify a cultivar the variance on the potency can only be 10% in their lab which is a very difficult standard to get to. There's a significant amount of other work. Do you have to do around stability testing and what. The other piece of this. You know is the fact that patients are. Quite stick. Wednesday you know find something they like. What are charge or competitive product. Unlike rack where you see massive share movements between top skus you don't see that in the medical. And there's clearly first mover advantage there's clearly. You know a consistency advantage of those companies that can keep stuff in stock. And it rolled out of the medical market so international cannabis. In most markets you're seeing maybe four companies possibly five companies making up. You know the lion's share of sales. As we've all talked about in a canadian racism example of top five companies you know do less than a third of the overall business and so i think the international business has proven to be sticky. And as you go forward. With the advent of things such as you know clinical research partnership with clinicians. These systems getting bigger i think you're going to still see you know in most markets big markets like germany that three or four companies will do the lion share of the business. Got it thank you. You very welcome. Find a question come from the line of john's imperial. Bib. People see what your. Thanks good evening i wanted to get back to to bevo and if we think about the evolution of aurora over time it used to be a pretty broad. Expansive business with multiple segments. All right then narrow down to be purely cannabis. And that was certainly outside the the core strategy of what the company was but what i'm wondering is was should we view this as devil was. Trying to optimize the decision. With sky or do you want to further diversify the business away from computer cannab. I. You know john i'm sorry if i know we talked about so i miss you and your folks this week. Here's how i would think about bebo everything that we do. Is about being a global leader in medical can. In order to do that. There are two things that we've been innately focused on one is profitability. And secondly is strengthening some core underpinnings. That we think will be an advantage to that pursuit of global you know. Leadership in in medical cannabis really interesting you know to us for a couple reason. One is about. And so the you know the tax option there. The use of sky the ability for it to very quickly without capex produce a significant amount of predictable. Profitable revenue was important to us. Secondly you know there are synergies and efficiencies we haven't gotten into them yet and we're not going to do it in disruptive way. But propagation is always been. You know this sort of interesting play in cannabis and while it's done in the us it's not really done. You know in canada and so the excellence of 80 plus years around. Propagation. There will be things that will come out of the bible system or the aurora system that will be additive. And as we look at agriculture. As a general sort of play and things around it we do see it it's additive now i don't. The concept of adjacency i do believe in staying close to the court. But if there are things. That are profitable. Is it good value for our shareholders. And is added in both financially and thematically particularly from a science standpoint to our overall. You know mission i think we're going to be interested in that and i know i'm pretty proud of this deal. For a lot of different reasons but you know proof of the pudding and i don't want to get over my skis too much on it but this is a really great team a really good use of assets capex light. And produces you know a lot of strength for us so we'll see. That's all but thank you. You're welcome. Amy chen with bmo capital market. People see with your. Hi thanks for squeezing me in my question is on the sign side particularly the licensing of genetics miguel i was just curious this particular aspect of the. Business. How do you see that fit within the overall aurora business like is this an area that you're very focused on you do want to expand. I'm like was the opportunity size that you see and i guess the last part of the question i have is you know whatever genetics that do come out of your r&d and innovation. That are good i'm just wondering like why don't you just keep that for yourselves and grow it for your own business whether it's your own medical or consumer segment thank you. You very welcome so it is something we're focused on aurora spent in an ordinate amount of time and effort on this. And it may. I don't want to say. It is but it may be one of the largest. Genetic facilities connected to cannabis in the world. And so as it pertains to that. There are significant advantages not just around var. And uniqueness of the cultivars say chasing potency and terp levels. Plant. You know i reference yield for gas is twice. 2x. The yield per square meter. Then some of our historical cultivars that totally changes. Footprint and all types of different things that are going on. There's incredible work being done on things like poverty mildew. And so what i've seen. Is that what you look at other agricultural categories. There are companies that are not branded. That are not participating from the manufacturing standpoint of selling their items but their genetics their science and they are participating this markets and we're all familiar with. No one's really doing that today you know on global scale. And we think there's a space there i also don't do it as a as a conflict. We have about a three share in the. We have a 24 share in the canadian medical business. And we have enough assets. In order to serve our pipel. Both domestically international as well as sell that. And some of these licensing deals you know are very innovative and and to be honest or not. Overly creative and you see him and other categories such as soybean and vegetables and tomatoes and other things. You know that we're around because of some of our partnerships. And so like i said we're excited about this. The last part of this while there are some lps doing this. There is a huge gap. From particular canadian lps in accessing you know world-class genetics they just haven't done the work and it's not something you can snap your fingers. And start up this is a 5 or 10 year process. Inbreeding and genetics and training in order to be there and so we're excited about what it means for us. Can you see some of those some of that stuff in the market we're all so excited about what it means. Get out from for being able to sell it and generating revenue streams cuz the reality is we're not going to have a 50 share of the rap business. And unlike some of my past businesses where you know we've been having these massive market shares so there's plenty of place to do it and as this stuff evolves you know it's our hope will be able to sell genetics internationally as well so i think it's a it's a great play. August the entirety of that span is already accounted for. And we think there's huge outside in in not only for us but for others in accessing those genetics and those incredible sort of science innovations. Okay thank you. You very welcome appreciate the question. I'm trying to call back. Martin court. Listen i appreciate everybody's interest you know our plan is absolutely on track and i understand you know as i mentioned with the regulations that the progression of a successful canvas company is not a straight line but in terms of. The cost efficiencies we've done and will do what we've said. We focused on those areas of the business that is profitable and we do see an upside and as these markets continue to come online. It's been medical first and then rack and you think aurora is in a great position so we appreciate your support we appreciate your interest. And we look forward to sharing our progress as we move forward best to all and your families wish you all but the best and we'll go from there thanks everybody. This inclusive is conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
