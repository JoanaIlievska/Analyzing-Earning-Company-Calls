Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at 5.2 billion. An increase of 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue through 13% embedded processing group 11%. And our other segment grew 20% from the year ago quarter. Now provide some insight into third quarter revenue by market. This corner i'll focus on her sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. As we continue to see the weakness we described in the second quarter. Industrial was about even sequentially. As we saw weakness begin to broaden in the industrial market. The automotive market remains strong and was up about 10%. Next communications equipment was up high single digits. And finally enterprise systems was up mid-single digit. Turning to our expectations for the 4th quarter. We expect that most of our end markets will decline sequentially. With the exception of the automotive market. Lastly we in our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of our manufacturing capacity. Which was outlined in our february capital management call. And will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content for system. Customers especially value the geopolitically dependable footprint. Of our manufacturing edition. We are now in production in our fab 2. And expect production in alfab later this year. In addition construction of sm1 and sm2. In sherman texas. Continues as plant. Raphael will now review profitability capital management and our outlook. Thanks babe and good afternoon everyone. But they mentioned third quarter revenue was 5.2 billion. A 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was 3.6 billion dollars or 69% of revenue. From a year ago gross profit margin increase 110 basis. Operating expenses in the quarter were 862 million. Up 8% from a year ago and about as expected. On a thrilling 12 month basis operating expenses were 3.3 billion or 16% of revenue. Restructuring charges for 77 million in the third quarter and are associated with the l5 factory that we purchased in october of last year. This charges will move to cost of revenue as we start production. The acid associated with the acquisition of the factory will begin to depreciate at the same time. Moving on operating profit with 2.7 billion in the quarter or 51% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was 2.3 billion. For $2.47 per share. Earnings per share included a two-cent benefit for items that were not in the original guidance. Let me know come in our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was 2.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures for 790 million in the quarter and 3.1 billion dollars over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis was 5.9 billion. In the quarter we paid 1.1 billion in dividends and we purchase one billion of our stock. In total we have returned 7.1 billion in the past 12 months. In september we announced we would increase our dividend by 8%. Martin are 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. Will increase our share with purchase authorizations by 15 billion. It's actions reflect a commitment to return a free cash flow to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with 9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter we issued 700 million in debt. Call dad outstanding was 8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.8%. Inventory dollars were up 205 million from the prior quarter to 2.4 billion. And days were 133. Up a day sequentially and below desired levels. 44th quarter we expect ti revenue in the range of 4.4 to 4.8 billion. And earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $2.11. This outlook comprehensive market conditions that dave previously mentioned. We continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. As you're looking at your models for 2023. Without additional changes to tax law we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about what it is in 2022. We got similar quarterly profile. Let me know make a few comments on the chips act that was recently signed into law. The combination of the investment tax credit the grants as well as funding for research and development will help make the us semiconductor industry more competitive. We accrued about 50 million dollars on the balance sheet in third quarter due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our us factories. It will eventually flow through our income statement it's lower depreciation. And we will we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. Impul. Will stay focused in the area that i value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology. A broad product portfolio bridge of our channels and diverse and long live positions. We will continue to strengthen this advantages through discipline capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities. Which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash up or share growth over the long term. With that let me turn it back today. Thanks rafael operator you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible and opportunity to ask a question please limit yourself to a single question after a responsible provide you an opportunity for an additional. Operator. Thank you. A reminder to participants. If you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your phone keypad. If you're using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow. How to reach our equ. Again press star 1. We also just a moment to allow everyone the opportun. It will take the first question from timothy arcury from ubs yolan is. Hi thanks dave i wonder if you can. Sort of going to any detail within distribution versus consignment maybe you know what i'm trying to get at is sort of any differences in you know demand-pull is measured by bookings inside distribution or. Demand pull from the consignment segment is you know one better than the other and if there and also is there any. Cancellations inside of of in the distrib. Yeah so on the first part tim we didn't see. Really any anything different between the direct business or that going through distribution as you know. You know we have had an effort. Over the past few years to have direct closer direct relationships with our customers for the amount of revenue going through distribution is much lower. Not today so. I probably only about 30% of our revenue actually goes through. Distribution we did see cancellations increased in the quarters unit just as customers work to align. The backlog to their. How do you have a follow up. Can you send us a very. So we will take the next question from vivek area bank of america secur. Going to need open please go ahead. But thanks to make my question for the first one it seems like consumer electronics says your biggest area of headbands and into three i think you said down with. And i imagine about the same kind of you know double digit down in q4. You think i'll be past the worst of the consumer or should we be expecting. You know the seasonal decline again for consumer in q1 i know it's a little bit further out but i just wanted to check what you're seeing in terms of consumer. I'm right now and i guess the bigger picture question that is. Sti more exposed to the cyclical downturn versus your pe. Because you have the highest consumer exposure and if that is the case. You need to do something different a given that makes headwind. Yep thanks for that question and the opportunity to clarify. So you know my personal electronics last year was 24%. Of our revenue and if you look at the market overall. Personal electronics a little more than 50% of of the semiconductor market without memory so. We have less than half of the exposure there. If you look at industrial and automotive that makes up 62% of our revenues. And inside of the market you know that's 26% of the market so we're really. Highly exposed to both industrial and automotive. And that's not by accident is you know you know probably more than a decade ago we. Began allocating more of our resources to automotive and industrial. In the emphasis there so we're very pleased with the with our exposure. And you know we believe that that will be where you know there just will be. More content added into those systems now that said there's great opportunities inside of personal electronics communications equipment and enterprise systems in the decades ahead. But we'll just have those secular tailwinds. You know more than than average inside of industrial and automotive. Yeah thank you dave so kind of similar question but on automotive. You know what you suggested grew 10%. Sequential. Guilty i'm interestingly you're suggesting it can grow again in a q4. What's your sense of kind of the supply demand balance in automotive among your tier 1 and then the auto oem. A customers you know many investors are concerned that. This kind of rolling correction that we are seeing in in semi is going to eventually hit. Automotive which has been a very strong area over the last you know one to two years. So what's your sense of what the kind of the supply demand balances in this automotive the end market. Yeah yeah you know i i'd say you know first i think when you look at the secular trends inside of automotive i think all of us know. That it will be a great grower for us you know and we're investing very broadly. So we're just thrilled with the position. You know if you look at second quarter of 20. Our growth there has you know off the bottom bend you know very very strong. You know will that market eventually roll over it will i mean that's just what happens. And we're not trying to predict you know when that will happen will continue to ship product to customers as they request it. And i will really focus on making sure we've got capacity in place. I for them over over the long term so. We're not really trying to worry about when when that will happen so thank you vivek and we'll go to go to the next caller please. Next question from joshua booklet from. Feelings open please go ahead. Hey guys thanks for taking my question i wanted to double click on the. Did anything change material. The quarter. Give us a linearity. Or by geograph. As we think about. Into the guide you. Is it more i guess conser. On the macro or was there a really material. Customers order pattern. Thank you. Yes joshua thanks for that question i would say if you look at the third quarter results. Across the board and and also inclusive of industrial. You know the quarter came in as we expected if you look at. You know an even sequential is not unusual inside of industrial that's about what we were expecting. But as we described as the weakness began to to broaden into that so. You know there wasn't one place that we could put the finger on to say it was you know one thing or one group of customers but we did see. Just different signals inside of there that is leading us to that conclusion that it is that weakness is broadening. And in fact we expect that weakness to broaden into into most of the other markets as well. As we move into fourth quarter. Of course with the exception of of auto so that that's really what we're seeing it's it's order rates if you look at order rates. Quarter to date they are of course consistent with with our outlook but they are we. A quarter today and so it's those types of signals that are leading to the to the outlook and and really those are the types of signals that are that really best inform you know what what our shipments in the quarter and in the short term are going to be. You have a follow-up. Yes thank you very helpful i also want to clarify the. You mentioned a 50 million. It was a crude on the balance sheet was that from the investment tax credit only. Is the second bucket for manufacturing incentives. And if not. When would you expect to go i guess get more clarity on. She'll be able to. The. For the manufacturing incentive port. The. Thank you. Yeah so first of me step back you know big picture the combination of the investment tax rate the grand as well as the funding for research and development will help make us semiconductor more competitive. We accrue the 50 million that that we talked about in the prepared remarks that you referred to that was for the 25% investment tax credit. That is for manufacturing assets. That i will go into service. In 2023 and beyond. And that is that was for 200 million so a quarter of that is what we accrued that we will we will receive from the government at some point in the future as a slower taxes. But in the in the p&l it flows it will flow through a lower depreciation. I think maybe what you're referring to when you talk about manufacturing is the grand portion. Is that what you're referring to. Maybe without the money if if you're talking about the grands that is that is part of the chips that but it's separate from the investment tax credit that remains to be seen that's more uncertain we will apply for those that application window doesn't open till february so we'll apply for those and as we learn more you know we'll let you know and and big picture in when we get to february the next capital management. You know since the last capital management surrounding long-term growth prospect. In our industry the secular trends that they talked about earlier that confidence has only grown so we feel really good about that so we'll tell you about the the net impact between those two the benefits of the the chipset and the growing confidence and the next capital management call. And in any changes to work your numbers based on. Great thanks. Thank you we'll go to the next caller please. Do you take the follow-up christian from timothy. Ub. Yolanda's open please go ahead. Thanks a lot day for. So my father was on china. And i wonder if you can talk about. Are you seeing any. Push out. Some of these. And i think also. You would talk about china being like. So so in rockville maybe you want to add to it but on the band. That the recent changes in some of the band. You know there there were companies added to the entities list overall. If we don't expect that. There's really much if any impact. Due to those those changes. I really do that or in any of the restrictions from. Overall from that too anything to add on that 99% of our bars fall in the very lowest category of restrictions just given the nature of the. The types of parts that we sell. So so you know we don't have restrictions on those of course their restrictions specific to entities. There's the entity list that you hear about the fdpr that's another. And we of course follow all the regulations when it comes to that so when an entity. Goes listed in there we take that into account and restrictions as. According to the law but given given up that works we don't expect any meaningful or significant impact to our revenue give with those export. Yeah and that was the first part of your question tim the second part. You mentioned high teens it's actually about 25% of our revenue comes from customers that are. Vista. That's so. Thank you tim and we'll go to the next caller please. Next one from state serious gun. Hey guys. My first one. I just wanted to verify. Are there any changes. To the trajectory of the. And just. From the changes in the current en. And i guess related to that. On the leh. I mean do you have any of those embed. 24 cuz you said it's. Online. Getting implied gross margin. Yes let me answer that that first one the last one first. So you see on our on our p&l about 77 million of restructuring charges in third quarter that is all because of that those are the lehigh cost that we chosen to put in there before he qualifies. Once it qualifies that that cost will move to cost of revenue so it will move to a grocery. Well it will happen during q4 of course not changing doesn't affect gps so you're just going to move and we don't guide the specific lines right. But if it qualifies then you know december 1st a third of that will go into cr and then all of it will be there for first quarter right if it qualifies december 31st. Then all of it will be in restructuring in fourth quarter and then all of it will move. In first quarter. Just to clarify that's already in. Evening profit and right order. Well short time. We expect our change or catholic expectation for 222 have not changed. That is a 2.6 to 2.8 billion for this year depreciation about $1 billion dollars for this year i'm talking 2022. Bigger picture as i said earlier the chipset grade of legislation we're very excited about that. That is going to decrease on a net basis. Our investment because we're going to get a 25% of reduction. From the investments that qualified the manufacture investments in the united states. But on the other hand if i alluded to earlier our confidence around in our long-term growth prospects have only grown over the last six to 12 month. Based on the secular trends based on input from our customers so we feel really excited about that the net effect of those two and whatever that does to our cap explains will tell you about that in february. Your phone sex. I do thank you i wanted to ask about op. Just been running in you know 800 million range plus or minus for quite a while and frankly people wondering how you've been keeping it there. In touch inflationary environment it is now taking off. But picking up his revenues are falling i guess why is it increasing now. Where is it didn't increase before and what happens going forward because if i would just hold it flat. On the revenue. They're going for to do something like 19% of evidence but it's still below your. Kind of what you talked about in terms of long-term targets for opex so how do we think about that why is it going now versus before and how do we think about. Where the range michael going forward. Yeah so so here's how we think about it step back you know for the last five and a half years really we've been running apex on a trailing 12-month basis which is how i prefer to look at it. At 3.2 billion dollars a pretty consistently we are really steady hand over that time are hiring has been very consistent during that time and that is under pain by a long term expectations on on growth and inside of that r&b has actually moved up as dna has moved down inside of that 3.2 but it's been really consistent on that. This last quarter for the first time he picked up to 3.3 billion dollars on a trailer into a most basis and i would expect that to continue picking up over the next many quarters and years as we continue stepping up our investments then that is. Hey you know driven by the higher investments but. Inflation is playing a factor is clearly wage inflation we're not immune to that so that is that is also. Affect them will continue to affect those. Okay thanks steve. We have blaine cur. From buck. Hey guys i think straight my question maybe just a clarification no. The question. You said that a fact but i didn't hear. Anything negative. Turn that. Too positive so i'm just going to curious. And i guess we'll see what march brings. I'm happy if you want to comment on that but it seems like. At least personal electronics is back to where you. Things like industrial kind of get back there and at that point. You're building inventories you had more cap. Then the man. If we do go back to those levels. And you're adding more capac. I'm just trying to understand. Is still the the view that you. Build inventory like. You still. Capac. Let me try to answer that i didn't fully understand the. You throw in several premises there but let me let me just address it the best way i can inventory levels. And and capacity so capacity we've been adding capacity incrementally for a number of quarters now off at 2:00 is in production. Lehigh lehigh is about to start production within a few months so clearly our incrementing incremental capacity. Is is going up. At the same time we've been increasing inventory very slowly and now more recently we added 200 million of inventory in this last quarter. But we are still below this our level. They keep in mind our business model is such where we are target the vast majority of parts sell to many many customers so. Are the very broad in nature the product life cycles of the parts is decades in many many times. The products themselves last 10 years in inventory most of them so. The risk of selection for the inventory is very very low the potential upset of having that inventory ready is very high so that's why we prefer to have more than left inventory so i would not be uncomfortable i said before adding another billion billion and a half dollars of inventory over the next. Several quarters to get us well positioned for the next up turn that invariably comes at some point. No problem. Back tonight it's going to ask you specifically on the auto. You said that's the only one that that's not down and obviously. It's very well known that it's been so so tight but just let him. Comments on on why that market is taking a bit longer than say industrial. Yeah you know i think as well documented i think is we went through the the pandemic it had the deepest. The correction from a starting point standpoint. You know the the mix of auto manufacturers to the high-end. You've got evs that are inside of those mix that are all adding to that. To those secular friends so. You know i think that we're well positioned as we make investments. Across our businesses but we're investing in. Powertrain which. Include electric vehicles and hybrid. I were investing in eight ass systems were vesting in an infotainment system. We're investing in body and lighting we that doesn't get talked about a lot. On conference calls will we just get we get as excited about turn signals as we do. About bms. And and then we also invest in in saf. I work growing very broadly we've got close to a thousand different automotive oems that. That we service. And we really believe that we've got to you know probably decades of growth ahead of us. That. Preparing. So thank you blank i will go to the next call please. We have for us. Deutsche. Hi. Ask a question. A high level one on your analog business. This year today i think it's up about 15%. Year over year with the midpoint issue of your guidance it seems like this year might be up about 10%, that's roughly half. Of what the broader market is running at can you guys explain a little bit about why you would be undergoing the market as defined by sia. And if you are is that something that you expect to mean revert because. You don't you lose this amount of share in a year unless there's something unique going on so any help in explaining that would be. Yes sir you know i think that. Whenever i'm asked that question and it's always a lot more comfortable to be out answering it when. We're up twice the the rate of the market it really need to look at it over a longer period of time so. You know look at the the rate of growth of us versus the industry from fourth quarter. Of of 19 i just picked that because it's a pre-pandemic number. And and we look we look you know very very good. Against those against those numbers so. You know we were as you remember who went into the pandemic. Continue to build inventory. So the numbers initially looked very very strong. As customers pulled up pulled product from us so. When you look at some of the sequentials were were hard. And that's not not making excuses but. When you look at our manufacturing footprints and how we're position. You look at the customer excitement around that that manufacturing footprint. Are you and customers look at where that addition is coming and. The geopolitical dependable. Locations of where that that footprints coming on. We are very confident in where the trajectory of our market share is going. How long. So you got to follow up for us. I do i just want to revisit the gross margin side not going into whether the lehigh charges are moving into cogs or not but are there any other moving parts because it appears at the midpoint of your revenue guy in your earnings guide if opex is roughly the same sequentially that the gross margin. I would have to go down you know the better part of two or three points. Just want to know if there's any other unique aspects implied in that guidance. Don't know what i'll tell you you know we're very pleased with our girls margin performance on a on a year and your basis the third quarter that we just finished is the default through was close to 80% and that is actually higher than the the guidance that would give him 70 to 75. What i would point you to is that you can see in the cash flow statement depreciation is increasing sequentially has increased sequentially for a number of quart. But this last quarter 27 million dollars of course that is a direct result of the capex investments that were making. And i thought you should expect depreciation to continue taking up i said earlier in the call. We expect this year to be close to a billion dollars so you. Obviously didn't do the math and get get fourth quarter of depreciation there but clearly that is. That is picking up and the the bulk of that depreciation goes into customer. Thank you okay. I'll go to the next caller please. Funniest joe mall from morgan stanley y. Please go ahead. Yes thank you i wonder if you could talk about. If the lead time environment. Has changed i know. Talked about there being hot spots in the past few quarters. Is that gone now or delinquency is kind. Back to below normal levels or where are you at. Yeah so we still do have the still do have hotspots you know in any market environment we got hot spots but we still. Have them. It probably still most pronounced in inside of automotive. Lead times you know didn't change much second quarter to third quarter. And you know the same time as we talked about before customers can get immediate availability. Of a products on on ti.com so you have kind of all those all those dynamics going. Yeah thank you for that. You know we're hearing from some of your. Industrial and automotive customers. A desire to hold. I've done what companies have. Historically held. Is that something. You guys see that i mean you think might affect the eye and. You know how do you think about that going forward. Do you think that's a that's a normal state of a. Yeah we you know we've we've we've seen and heard and been in those discussions. Before you know we know that there are some customers that are really taking a hard look at at their supply chains where their product is coming from what technologies they're being built on ensuring that they've got the supply of those technologies. As part of the reason why you know when they look at. You know product being built in and the capacity we're putting in place at the. You know 45 to 130 nanometer they know they need that capacity for for decades. To come so they they you know they get excited about when they see that capacity overall. But the change will supply you know the supply chain. Is really hard work that it will take a long time to be able to do it it's not often times just as simple as. Carry more inventory you know on the balance sheet so you know they're probably will be some of those customers that you know do that hard work and restructure the supply chain. And they're probably will be some that you know once we get supply and demand and balance it just kind of fall back into normal practices so. You know i think time will tell is that as that plays out rafalea is that for us to hold more inventory we're in a great position to do that given the nature of that inventory that is cataloging nature i can sell to many many customers so. Then we're all better off at our customers will be better off when we hold more than inventory and we can direct. Where is most need. So that's why as i said earlier we are going to continue growing inventory we still below this other levels and we will add a significantly more inventory over the course to. Be ready for the next upside. Great thank you joe i will go to the next caller please. With the williamstein from. Pretty your. Okay thank you very much for taking my question. I want to ask about ti.com in. Past quarters i think maybe even a quarter go you talked about how. Percent of revenue from that channel had gone from less than. Going to sales. Occur in about a one year. Time frame. You just mentioned a moment ago dave that this is the channel where customers can go for. Nearly immediate availability so. I would assume that they get that availability at a price. And that. Can you start softening as you're alluding to on this call. A more prec. Decline did we see that during the quarter and do you anticipate that to happen. Yes yeah and we did see a decline there and. Yeah we'll finish up the year and provide an update in our capital management of how it did for. The year won't be something that will be reporting out on a quarterly. But they're there was a decline there. Not that it was unexpected. Not longer term is a fantastic channel. Right out to engage customers on a number of levels and customers are very pleased so you know they will be fluctuations quarter to quarter maybe even year to year but over the long term is we're very pleased with with that channel and what he's doing to get us even more directly engage with. Absolutely. Yeah sort of along the same line you know there there has been some speculation in the press for example that. This has been a channel for. Companies that you might call brokers or some people call. Gray market. Abus. To get their hands on ti product. There is still inventory. It was acquired. By by such. Parties that is still. Floating around and. I wonder whether. Found. A better reason to maybe. Track that and measure it. Any observations. With regard to. Yeah and and well as you know i spent eight years in my career in sales and. You know they're i have always been brokers in our market. Is rafael talked about you know we've long believed that only can controlling. Our inventory is a strategic. Advantage so. You know in having policies of like non-cancelable orders and things like that as customers take product. That they don't need that's typically the source of. Of that product going out the back the back door for for broker so. You know can can brokers go on to ti.com and get to get products you know they can. But. You know that's that's pretty minimal in comparison to to other sources that they might be able to to get it so. You know overall the majority of customers that we service our customers that we have large engagements with the directly. Thank you and we'll go to go to the next caller please. We'll take cj muse from everco yolanda's open please go ahead. Yeah good afternoon thank you for taking the question i guess the question on end market. December. You know if i'd kind of adjusted the down 12% sequential for the strength and auto it looks like. You know all your other business. Is attracting you know at least down kind of mid team so curious. You know what what parts of the market are are down. You know it's usually i would think you know the other the. The calculators would be one and what are what's maybe more down. In terms of the correction that you're saying. And in cj just to clarify you're talking about the fourth quarter guidance. Yeah yeah so again you know we're not trying to provide guidance by quarter over by by each of each market inside of that we you know we are expecting obviously with the guide overall it is. You know a week or fourth quarter than a typical 4th quarter. So you know with the exception of auto as we've talked about the. You know we'll continue to see weakness inside a personal electronics but we will see the other the other markets we can as well. So you know we're not trying to get to get specific on on that. So we'll finish up the quarter and and report that out but we do expect the the weakness to broaden across those markets. How do you have a follow-on. Yes please. The phone. Forward question to to china. And and you know obviously you talked about very little impact. For me embargo on your business but curious. You know as you contemplate. China's ability to invest. I'm assuming it'll take years if not decades. To try to compete. High performance analog but just you're curious how your thoughts are are evolving. For china. Competitor to you you know. In the coming decades. But i will tell you at the end of the day it all comes down to our competitor advantages right and it starts with the the broad portfolio that we have in the analog and embedded. You need a huge portfolio to compete effectively particularly in industrial and automotive. And we have you know 80,000 or so parts that we sell to 100,000 different customers. You need that type of a diversity then second is manufacturing and technology. This investments that are positioned 300 mm. First but then all the investments that were making are just building on that. I thought we have r5 to come in and i just came online. A new factory in lehigh and the mega side that we just broke ground. In sherman that's going to have a four factories each one the size of a r52 so that really puts us in. In a very strong opposition to compete against. Anyone where there is in the united states or. Or in china. That's.
