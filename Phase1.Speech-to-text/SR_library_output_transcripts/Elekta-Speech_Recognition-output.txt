Good morning everyone and warm welcome to the presentation of electra second quarter 2022-23. My name is cecilia characters and i'm ahead of investor relations at elekta. With me here in stockholm i have gusto salford electric president and ceo. And our cfo to be as head club who will be presenting the results. Today's agenda starts off with gusto presenting some highlights of our development. Then to be as we give you details on the financials and the presentation will end with gustav's view on electus outlook. And after the procession there will as usual be time for your questions. Before we start i want to remind you that some of the information discussed on this call contains forward-looking statements. And these can contain. A projections regarding revenue operating result cash flow as well as products and product development. And these statesmen's involve risk and uncertainties that may cause actual result to differ material from those set forth in the statement. And with that said. I head over to you. Thank you cecilia and hello everyone. And and that's always thank you for for joining the call and i would like to start on how we delivered on our strategy in. Q2. So during that the quote we truly continue to focus on the execution of access 20-25 and i would also like to take you through some of the key areas and highlights. We released new innovative solutions across the portfolio and also into new markets. I'll go through them in more detail later in the presentation but i would like to highlight the launch of comprehensive motion management for unity with true tracking and automating. Also the launch of alexa is free at astro and also getting the fda regulatory clearance. And we also are expanding our global service portfolio with the launch of alexa care 360. When it comes to driving the adoption across the globe and the availability of care we have set the target. To reach more than 300 million people in anderson marcus until. 2425. And we are well on track to reaching this target and outcome so far halfway in is that 150 million people have. I received the opportunity for radiotherapy. To support or resilience and more expansion we initiated a cost reduction initiative lost quarter. Is progressing i must say very well and delivering towards the plan of 450 million sex in savings on a run rate basis in the end. Of the fiscal year. So if we now turn to the markets and and order development we saw that the global macroeconomic challenges continued to drive uncertaint. And resulted in a bit of a cautiousness and soft or the development. But the development was very very mixed. In the different markets and geograph. For example in america with a weaker momentum in canada and south america. But to order intake in the us was at last year's levels. Awesome mexico showed good or the growth and included high-end imaging and radiotherapy bundle deal. And roll so so start to see a lot of positive contribution and from our partnerships. In the region as well as in other reg. Enemy. We continue to see a strong order momentum contribution from the large tender in spain as well as in the middle east. And we were also selected to deliver the majority or 37 verse hds to modernize the large part of italy's installed base. But i must say that these orders will first come in the remaining quarters on the q3 and q4. The decline in the region was driven by softer development in northern europe as well as in africa. So if we turn to a park then we saw that china came back to a healthy or the growth of almost 10%. But we saw the motorcycle growth in the number here to be really explained by the weaker development in large metro market such as japan and australia new zealand. We saw east asia had a positive development with korea as the main driving country. And in india we had a deal in accordance health care that was a crying several verse hds and harmony pro system. And if you go to revenue and we sold at the revenue decline in the second quarter the installations they were negatively impacted by continued supply chain disturbances. Yeah look downs in china and to some extent also customer readiness. We sort of revenue dropping in america and the mayor and but we saw growing us installations and revenue as well in in europe. So the negative development an apac was mainly impacted as we said by the lockdowns in china. We saw the recurring revenue in service at the good growth rate of 7% and this is higher than the growth of the install base of 5%. That is now reaching around 5,100 units of linux units and lexile gamma knives systems at the end of the quarter. And i also want to highlight that we have a record strong order backlog and it is supporting increased installations and grow. Going forward. So if you're not turn to some of the key product launches and i would like to start with with service and in order to drive this service growth going forward. Hey we continue to strengthen our position in customer lifetime companion and we're increasing our value-added services. By the launch of electric care 360. And it's really about expanding the portfolio with services such as to symmetry consultancy services physics start. It's about aiming an enhancing customers clinical operations. And it's also important to say that we offer this in a vendor neutral set of services. That is both applicable to our own install base but also in excite. And again this is supporting service growth going forward. We started in in the us in america some will roll it out globally as we go forward. And one of the absolute highlights on the quarter and something i really experienced in in astra what's the launch of comprehensive comprehensive motion management for unity. With the true tracking and automatic gating functionalities. And these features are absolutely key and they are driving efficiency and productivity. As well as creating opportunities for content treatment courses fewer side effects and improve outcomes for cancer pat. So far we have received see you mark as you know and we have also submitted or if they application that's now pending. And i really really pleased to report out that the first patient was treated earlier this week with comprehensive motion management. So we also experiencing the build. All the clinical evidence for unity. Astro number of abstracts clinical abstracts showing the power and promise of unity. And we had a great study on prostate cancer that showing that there was no significant decline in quality of life in the cohorts using mr guidance and online adaptation. Riverside we're asking to code not using online adaptation there was a decline. For pancreas cancer patients reported adverse the limited adverse effects and stable global health status. Out to 3 months. And importantly 67% of patients were like one year off to the end of a treatment. And this out counts are positive compared with historic outcomes for pancreatic cancer. I know so of course to espion and taking a spread to the us and and to astro so we continue this this roll out and electric display it has both c and fda regulatory clearance. So it is enabling patients with brain disease cancer and other tumors to benefit from the most advanced gammai platform enabling more personalized rated surgery with sub millimeter accuracy and treating planning treatment planning in less than 60 seconds. So with this new launches sp comprehensive motion management for unity and alexa care 360. Will together with our work with price improvements across the portfolio positive contribute to revenue and more than growth going forward. So without over to you. To. Thank you girl stuff and good morning everyone. I will not start with the q to financials. Total net sales decreased by 5% organically in the quarter driven by the supply chain disturbances and covid restrictions in china. Our installation volumes were negatively impacted but we are pleased with the continued good girls and service. Net sales in the americas decreased by 3%. Which sold at sales in the us while canada decline in a quart. That says to me i decreased by 7%. Good girls and europe offset by lower sales in the middle east and africa. Good night back nut size decreased by 5%. Impacted by lockdowns in china as well as lower insulation volumes in japan and australia. In doubt continue to show good growth in a quarter. Our adjusted gross more than decline in a quart. We saw a clear impact on fx on our p&l. Foreign exchange right. I had a positive impact on our gross morgan. While exchange rates hedges had a negative impact on our operator morgan. In total the fx effect was positive 7 million sec on ebay. Compared to last year's second quarter. Our adjusted even more than came in at 7.7%. Then let's look at our gross morgan bridge. Our adjusted gross morgan amounted to 37.3% in a quarter. The loan that says growth contribute to negatively by 160 basis points. Improved mix from selling relatively more service than solutions. Contributed positively by 140 basis points. Foreign exchange rates. How to pulsative impact of 140 basis points mainly driven by the strengthening of the us dollar. Supply chain challenges continue and increasing inflation still puts significant pressure on coax. And a totally impact on adjusted gross more than from high supply chain costs and inflation. Was 250 bas. Negative. Then looking into our expenses. Selling expenses increase by 30% year over year in the second quarter. This was driven by more important customer events and meetings including travel and exhibition. Such as astro and launch events in china. Sequentially our selling expenses declined by 2%. Our administrative expenses for flat year and continue to decline sequent. Metro in the expenses decrease both your year and even more so sequentially. I will now return to the development of the. R&d expenses later. All in all year over year expenses increase by 3% in constant exchange rates but declined 6% sequentially and we start to see the results of our cost reduction in a. So let's look into our spend reductions in more detail. Our coast reduction initiatives has been successful and is progressing according to plan. As you're so on the previous slide our expenses all the clients sequentially. The coaster that can initiative has reduced our span by 50 million sec year of the year in the quarter. Or which 10 million effect in cokes. Authority million effect in gross r&d. And 10 million affecting selling an ad. For the full year we continue to expect a year-over-year spend reduction of approximately 200 millise. And by the end of this fiscal year. We expect to have reduced a run rate of spending by. 50 million sec. Esperanto laws quarter 150 million will come from coax reduction. 200 million from optimizing on this band. 100 million from lower selling. Expenses. The one of schools for implementing these call savings or estimated to be up to 400 million sec. So far implementation costs have amounted to 131 million. 52 mill. Impacted. Our cork. If you don't look at the grocery. And the girls are in the increased year of year. But decreased sequentially as seen in the left and short. Our acceleration and investment in innovation peak and q1 as previously communicated. In the right and. We can see the girls are in the house of stabiliz. Super central net sales. Rolling 12 month bas. Capitalization in. Compared to last year but decreased sequent. How much i station was stable both your year and sequent. Let's look into the networking capital development. I will not working capital as presidential net sales on the 12 months rolling basis a mountain to -2% in a. And continue to follow a normal seasonal pect. In the quarter we continue to build inventory due to the continued long lead times. Increase level of shipments to secure future installations than to higher higher accounts receivables and. Adv. Then if we look into our cash flows. Everyday amounted to 465 millisecond 1/4. Texas interest not another the next staple there amounted to. 19 million neg. This consisted of the texas paid amounted to 145 million sec. And the remain is is mainly related to currency revaluations. The changing working capital amounted to 202 million sec negative as discussed on the previous slide. Cash flow from operating activities and mounted to approximately 55 million negative this resulted in an operational cash conver. On the road like 12 month bas. Our continuous investment amounted to 362 m. Mainly driven by r&d investment in the lena family. And software to strengthen our product. Oil and all our casserole after containers investment. 417 million sec neg. Now let's turn slide and look into our financial position. I would not talk to you today. Raise your mounted by the end of the quarter to 1.38. Worth noting in the current mac. Economical. Is that we have a low refinancing ris. With only 500 millisecond immaturities until mar. 225. Our interest bearing liabilities have an average maturity of 3.6 years. Oil and old we have a strong balance she. Which good financial. So what. Thank you to be us and now we're just like to share some comments about or outlook and summarize the quarter so if we turn to the outlook we as you've seen and heard we we expect uncertain macroeconomic environment and the supply chain challenges to continue to impact. Installations question mark. We're looking forward and looking into q4 we we see that the situation should gradually improve during the fourth quarter. And as always i would like to highlight that the long-term market trends is truly supporting growth and investment in high-end radiotherapy equipment and more than expansion. So if we look forward and look until 2425 or outlook period or mid-term outlook paired. We continue to see nurses compounded annual growth rate above 7%. And a bit more than percent expansion. And a dividend policy of at least 50% of net income. And yes to summarize the quarter we continue to see the macroeconomic challenges. Impacted. Orders revenue and morty's in q2. We so great new launches and price improvements that will contribute to revenue morning growth going forward. And we'll see that the cost reduction initiative is on track. And will expand or mar. So what without i hand it over to you so. I think you go stop now we continue with the q&a sessions so please operator over to you to open up. For the first person in line for questions. We would not begin the question and answer session. Anyone who wishes to ask a question may press started one or they touched on telephone. You will hear tone to confirm that you have entered the queue. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue. Give me press start into. Participants are requested to use only hot sex. While asking a question. Any question my press start and run at this time. The first question comes from the line of eric castle from abg central courier please go ahead. Hi good morning everyone so service perform. Fairly well but against the backdrop of weak solution sales. I mean based on that are you seeing customers go for. Service message to to prolong the lifestyle of the elena rather than just outright replacing it. You know considering the the softer hospital culpix environment we're seeing now in more mature markets. I wouldn't say that's the main drive i think the main driver is that we add more value to the installed base so more service offerings a bit more of the sas solution as well driving a higher service growth but also higher service contract penetration and as you know we we are going direct and quite a few of the expanding markets when it comes to going direct to the left operations. And then we take over the service in that country and that that is also positive driver for our service grow. So i don't see a big trending in in a customer's pushing forward capex decisions and and take more service revenue. And. Okay interesting thank you and then i was just thinking could you perhaps expand on your guidance and why you expect the recovery to start. Thank you for but for it to remain. Challenging q3 i mean what sort of visibility have you gained to support that view. No great question eric and unless i often say we we can look into say two quarters into the future when it comes to our shipment plans when it comes to installation plans when it comes to the also the order back look to some some example but if we focus on on revenue. Then you have those two quarters for the first quarters kind of fill up to very large extent we enter into that quarter with machines going out to to install base. And then the second quarter so for now q4 then you have a plan for those installation dates and the machines going out and then the upgrades and everything around it. And there we see a positive driver. High volumes in in our plants. It's also important to say that quite a lot of the logistic challenges we've seen for such a long period of time now is improving it's easier to get a hold of sea fre. The rates are going down and the air freight we can transfer more. To see. And all of this has a positive impact on. On on a morgan stan that has been a big dragon on the morning since the last. What is it 67 quarters now. And when it comes to to supply chain. So this is about that improved visibility that i'm helping the customers to be ready to take on the installations. So we can then also take the revenue when we start. The insulation so it's about our own transparency into the coming quarters. Okay that's very interesting to her just just one last if i may i mean you restrict the midterm out. But i'm thinking especially about the ebit margin improvement over the period when you're trending a far way of that right now so could you perhaps talk about what. Neighbors you you expect to. You know she drive. Expansion over the period. Say i can take the longer term perspective and then i'll hand it over to today has to kind of go through the bridge and and how how we see it right now if you take the long-term perspective and as we said in captain marcus a day we we were quite stable on the 41 42% historically. Now we've seen it in significantly impacted by by supply chain. Coast and so on almost 500 basis points if you adopted to quarters effects in in the q2. So now we see rather improvement of that and then we offset some of the inflation when it comes. The price increases that does your note takes a bit of time before it turns from order backlog to revenue. But we we see those effects that will come. Future quilters. So i think that's why we also optimistic on the modern expansion on on the ebit line. And if you don't take the more effects in the current quarter i'll hand it over a bit to be. To give some more flavor there. Yeah sure and thanks for the question i mean in general when when you look at okay where are our. Morgan right now when a few more to take a sort of a longer perspective i mean. We should have them a drivers both in a growth price cause reduction and also when you look at the fx component as such. Yes that did the leveling out here and they had she impact i will also improve. So so that disorder yeah there are many livers and of course then. You need to take into consideration the things will happen in the market etc going forward but. There. I would point at all these flavors in in a little bit but that. Item is substantially lower that we will have. Some of the increase here for amortizations but but other than that i. Those four would be the before i would point that if you think where are our operating more than now and why should it improve. Okay thanks very much just coming to best i'll jump back in the. Thank you thank you eric. The next question. Prettiest. Please go ahead. Hi there might just walked in from first question relates to you with orders in q2 you're right in the report. Order cautiousness in the us at the same time highlighting that it remains on the previous years high level so. If we looked at the us isolated would you say there are any reasons for being coercious i had. Or how do you say that how you been talking in the report. Yeah i think of course we want to grow an old markets and now it came in there i was a flat on the orders in q2 that i mean as you remember law school there was a weak development in the us so for me that's what kind of a positive signal. Then also taking part of a lot of customer discussions during astro i saw a great interest in in unity especially now with comprehensive motion management the gamma knife the same as service the same so i think we have many levers to to drive to to address the us market. Then of course there's increased interest rate capex freezes at some customers but it's a very mixed. Situation in the us where you have parts of the market really continuing to invest in in new capacity. And then some words it is tougher but i think we have the right products and kind of tools to to address the market and drive growth going forward as well. Thank you very much and then my second one you know going back. 2:41 you expected flash installation year rear in q2. That way the results coming in we have solutions down some 30% period. She can just figure out the main components to work as the period of things done. Because you expected this headwind to remain in quarter to back. Two that maybe would you say you like the customer readiness has gone worse or or water is sitting during the quarter. No i think it's great coleman tennessee remember what materials is referring to is we said that the installation would be the same the numbers would be the same as as. Had a previous quarter last year so what happened is really a lot to do with china so we had quite severe covid lockdowns in parts of china and was difficult to get some of our products in during those lockdown. It it was both. On the linux. But it was also on the gamma knife side if you compared to to the court the last year. So that is the main reason for for the solutions decline in the quarter. We expect that to come back of course we see positive signals on the order intake in china i was close to to 10%. So i think we're still positive on china but sometimes it is difficult to predict this kind of lockdowns and when we can can install. But the road we are optimistic on china. That's a good clarification. Covington searching us on i just wanted to see if you have. Comment on deck development and what's your seeing there are you seeing anywhere in signs right now or. Or you know. System. I think that's one of the most if of course one of the most difficult things to predict is this lockdowns but what you can know is that there's lots of chinese customers that want to have the lynx installed. So it's much more about getting to the customer start the installation of them when the lockdowns are released. We have a large backlog we have positive signals on the order side. And we've taken a lot of market share game so so i think it's more than installations that will come. But it's difficult to predict how the covid lockdowns will hit. That's perfect thank you very much. Thank you thank you about this. Next question comes from christopher. I'm. Please go ahead. Yeah thank you coming back to the previous question about disability. Again i think you had a good explanation about china but. Based on. The three months ago you thought it would be flat now it for storm 30%. So really do you have any disability for. 4th quarter. Yes thank you it christopher so if you go through the third quarter into the fourth quarter i mean yes we have the visibility of the installations we are doing those two quarters especially during q3 then in q4 it's it's fill up to relationship. But still some you need to plan out with a customer to see when we start the installation and you need to ship them. And i think we have quite the stable environment in most of the world actually now with customer readiness it's a bit more expensive for them to install the product. But still it we get them there it is china that is a bit of uncertainty due to a.m. the lockdowns as we mention. But overall i would say that that the transparency in the predictability has increased during the last quarter and i think we will see the benefit of that. Into especially q4 but those are better predictability in in q3. And giving you your comment to china i said absolute majority of the deviation from from fl. Fucking for sanitary. In the solutions in in the quarter does that mean you couldn't do any installations at all in china so that was down. 100% for. I know it's not 100% but we had if you compared to last year and and the plan we had it it is you know it's linux and it's it's gamma knife so it's it's not. 100% but it's significant to down if you compared. The plan and also what we had. I lost your. Dunham already capitalization and i want to say. Could you provide some some alto care for the. Next of the year or the rest of the year. Specifically how we should view that for. Sure i can do it at that thank you crystal for so i should have walked you. So here in the quarter which was exactly what we said here in in q1 was that i mean we had. We had a reduction here of of the grocery and then the capitalizations. Follow that the consequently and then we have here in the court today is stable amortization and. Thank you too. If you don't look your head now when you break this components down. You can afford a respect the slide decline of the the grocery. You can also have a expect a slide decline down that will follow all the capitalizations. And then in terms of the amortization that will as previously communicated that. Gradually increase throughout the year. So yeah those are three components there. But does this mean that the capitalization next fiscalier will be down versus this year. Yes that will mean that yes. But it's also sold that we we sold to when. Maturity projects the capitalization rates go up a little bit. If you see that the impact there from the grocery store in the is actually a little bit bigger than that so yes that means. Okay. And my final question you said that. Supply chain. Challenges and inflation had. Negative impact of 2.5. Percentage points on on the grocery. I think it would be helpful maybe if you could provide some in a split that up a little bit given your your commentary about. Improved or signs of improvements in in when it comes to supply and also lower freight. Going forward yes. And it's a fat coleman right then to point there is a quite a broad area but just the mansion i'm being bothered in. Terms of visibility and also in the current landscape i. You see that that. Frank writes are trending in a positive. Don't say we see that those in our p&l when we look at our. Logistical stuff for example i think it was the visibility here even though it's still a challenging. Environment in terms of the getting. Sometime. So so those things but but overall there if. Supply chain challeng. And there you see improvement. What you actually see then and why this is actually now it's still a big items is that. Inflation has hit our p&l here and why is that then. It's a lot of that has to do with an indirect material impact so that we. You know we are to launches than the assembly and company and the components here with the material content in those. And those. Man material price is goes into increases there for the components that we buy and that leaves them to cost the increase that would classify here. As inflation so that is actually worth. What we've seen here. In this fiscal year. So that that is how. Explain. Do you see down the risk that even if rate costa coming down. Supply is just getting better. Do you serious. Because of. Anymore. Overall general inflation. Federal sporting with still not improve. So i think i mean from my point there cuz that's that's the price increase i initiatives were doing to to upset some of that inflation and and we see that that we have. Targeted orderly knocks only got my life across the portfolio and also service contract the cpi courses or index closest. To to offset that affect on that level so that's how we work with the inflation when it comes to offsetting it with price in. And and we start to see that we've been doing that on the service side for quite a while now when inflation start to increase and we've also done it on on the solution side so some of that you will see in the coming quarters. But without price. Says is it so that inflation on your materials etc is. That look. Improved freight. Improved supply situation. That would. Be enough to help the girls. So did you you fully depend on. Price. I i am trying to answer that question i mean of course that we are targeting and price increases we we need to do that. It's not the only lebron as you know it's running a management and pianos is several components i mean. This is everything when we look at our gross more than development to. Drive a healthy growth and to actually have a healthy. When you work with your products and codes over time how you do things smarter to have a productivity. Improvement there it's always about. To drive consistency in the mix of actually selling more profitable products etc. So so that they're all at several livers but i think that to the point that i mean. In an inflationary climate i mean we. We can't be stuck in the the value chains of course if we need to work with price but it's not the only thing that we have. Okay thank. Thank you. The next question comes from robert. From august. Please go ahead. Good morning thanks for taking my questions i just wanted you made some comments already around the the trends in the us but just be kind of curious in terms of the overall bankrupt in the us what do you put the kind of. I guess this is sluggish and sluggish development in order to grow down to is it really sort of weakness on procedure volume staff shortages supply chain issues can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what's going on in the us side and then just regionally if you can map out where the i like the unity orders are actually coming from thank you. Yes so if i start with the us situation now we came in in flat as i mentioned. But then there is a discussion as as you all are very aware of our capex in hospitals going forward and how that will impact different med tech areas. There i think it's important to say that the radiotherapy is still a very profitable. Segment of of hospital medtech investments. So so we foresee that that will continue. And then i also mention this kind of consolidation of a quite fragmented. Rate of therapy market in the us on a customer operator side we expect that to continue. And that often results in increased investments actually in in new capacity. So i mean i'm optimistic for the artif. In in the capex environment in the us. And i think it's important for say too it's for for licked as well working with. Or imaging part. Also opens up doors and and that's a good and potential growth driver for ford actor ford. So so i'm i'm optimistic about alexa's role in. In the us market. Thank you i'm just a story of the theater almost around the elector unity orders maybe if i can tag one alongside that just be curious on the regional development in europe is there any so significant differences in country development in across europe because obviously that was down high single digit in the quarter just kind of be curious if there was anything that sort of swung that particularly. Out on the order side you mean robert. Oh and. Yes so if i start with the unity question i'm in that that's quite. Broad based in in both the emerging markets but also in and for example the us on the unity side so there's no. Specific. Specific area that stands out so you should see this as a very global product right now that can address most countries around the world. With with unity from a regulatory point of view and that's what we're doing it's europe it's it's. China it's a murder market in the east the us. So i think that's a positive trend. And then if you look at the european dynamics i think. Before the industry i think the big. Investment programs in southern. If it takes pain if you take italy and they have been key growth areas. A bit weaker in central and northern europe is what we have seen so far. About selling southern europe is driving. Okay next question. Comes from california please go ahead. Yes thank you and firstly on on the installation side it would be would be. Think to hear. How it turned during the court dresses. Spend a lot of time talking about the chinese lockdowns here. And also please if you could put this into any any sort of numbers or perspective since. Since your guided for flat installation volume. Into this quarter ending quite far off. So what is the baseline that you start from here when you moved into november please. Yes and then tell him that question it's important to to understand kind of our supply chain as well so if you shift something from to china that would be two even two and a half months on on a boat and getting it there the product through customs and so on. And where else if you do installation and say europe it could be days or weeks between when we ship from the uk and and reaching the customer. And then us somewhere between. So i think it's easter to predict. At european insulation compared to. Installation so those machines were on their way to the customers but the lockdown hit us and i was difficult to predict throughout the quarter. Because they're on their way. It's easier as i mentioned in europe and to some extent the us as well to with the predictability. So it was china but what's the big big delta. When it comes to both linux and gamma knives when we refer to installation volumes in the first. Outlook into the second. Okay and since you're now refraining from providing a similar statement into q3 rather than. Do you know seeing the similar trends does that mean that that you still struggling china. Will installation volume slightly. Lay down in q3 as well and any sort of figures around that would be helpful. I think china is we have a big backlog we have a huge need and four installations we see all the growth as a mansion we've taken lots of market share. Throughout the last year. So it's it's more than it's a bit unpredictable how the lockdowns will impact the market also in the in the third quarter. Okay but you see similar. Sort of impact here in november is that correct. Yes it's still a bit certain areas are still in lockdown so it's more challenging to operate a supply chain in those regions or areas where they are locked. To recover. All right thanks that just just finally from my side also on the gross margin. Coming back to the inflationary pressures and supply chain related inflation as well. 250 basis points in this quarter. You talk about price having. Somewhat of an impact and we gradually have more of that so. I. What what's your expectations on price to start off with any sort of figure you can provide us with and then just secondly. This head. I would not be. In similar magnitudes for full. For. That is my final. If you look at an inflation you have seen the numbers in in all the different geographies it was quite a lot in europe it was a lot in in the us a bit less in parts of eight pack in china so i think that's the first thing we want to do upset with with our price increases that we have done across the portfolio. And you've seen stories that the mail take segments or be somewhere between say 5 to 10 10 even 15% for some product. What price increases due to this effect. And and then it's about of course you need to get that price increase when you negotiate or in the tender process and so on. So that the price realization will be a bit lower than than your list price increases. But i think we've seen a good trend there we see that the prices in in the average they were doing is is going up. And so i think. We see the right trend. And also a trend that will upset the inflation then of course it's very difficult to know where inflation is head. Going forward. We see good price realization. I am. Market by market. Okay so you won't be able to provide sort of. A view on when the balance between price hikes that that you're doing. Moving the right direction. Compared to the cost that you have today let's say. Whether or not that they will increase further on. That's i don't have that crystal ball no i cannot predict that really. Because i cannot predict inflation. Okay thanks. The next question comes from juliano from bank of america. Please go ahead. Good morning and thank you very much for taking my question so i have three please first one is just follow up on the midterm guidance question that you had at the beginning but more latest specifically on sale so sales of meet single digit last year likely lower this year and so it seems that you will need to grow top line by let's say double digit number over the next couple of years just to meet the the midtown guidance do you think you will need just rest at some point in the future and just if no could you stress the kindling past to reach it especially for the top line because you already provided for the for the for the beat. Next question just on cash flow could you tell us when you we should expect a normal situation with cash conversion returning the title historical level also you seems to have some loans to customers in emerging markets so any color on the size of these loans will be super helpful and last question on the backlog and price increases and all the backlog at recover at the moment. Could you tell us what part of your backlog has an asp significantly lower than your current address it's selling price and if it's still profitable for you to produce this system today. Thank you very much. Thank you thank you so i think i would take maybe the first and last question i'll take your hand over to cash flow crescented to be us but if we look at the midterm revenue outlook we're saying more than 7% cable of the year and i agree last year was 4%. I will see what where this year ends up. But we are guiding continuously the outlook of more than 7% that was assuming and market growth of six to eight percent i think that's important to say as well. Looking at what we have ahead of us i mean we have a backlog of 43 billion sec. That is very i mean that should be installed throughout that period of course. We saw before covid. And mark gets growing double digits when you look at the orders if you take a full industry. So i think there there's a huge on the map need and potential for cancer care radiotherapy. And my lesson plan a little bit from the previous financial crisis in '08 or 9 was that. Capex medtech rt hell up quite well in that environment as well and continue to grow. So so i mean i'm i'm optimistic on on the years ahead of us here when it comes to. At rt investments in cancer care investment across or or geograph. But a lot of girls will come from of course underserved areas like china. Like a pack like europe you can say as well and and many other areas and then we will work with adoption when it comes to new products like unity like it spray. As well in in more mature market. Like the us for example. So so. As you hear i'm i'm i'm optimistic about the industry and i'm off the mystic about electus growth in the coming years. And for the cash flow and cash conversion quest and i hand it over to to. Yes hello and thanks for the question. Yeah so i i think yeah i mean first of all with you i mean you see the slide and and you also know the business is that i mean we do have a seasonality in the the. In our cash flow one of course then i mean that itself is it's actually done. Leading also to a relative improvement but if you're more structurally okay and look into. A higher cash conversion i mean here they're working capital has followed the normal seasonal trajectory. And that is i mean we might need from time to time to specific airport terminal talk here about. And. I was talking about inventories in order to meet them. Current situation. But otherwise i mean you see now the reduction of the girls are in the. I mean with this. Development thank you for also that i mean of course. Onyx moves along with that as well and which then it sounds also have an impact on cash conversion so. Even though i'm in a gradual improvement there. So that's how i would then say it. And then if you come to the order backlog recovery and we discussed the asp quite a lot in the order backlog and then if you split up to the back log around 50% of it is service related and the service related backlog. It's a very large extent to get cpi closes on so index closest. For the rest of the backyard of course we feel it now a bit with the best pricing. But it's key thing also with launches. So launches hasn't even bigger if impact on on pricing for new products because it's a new value you bring to the customer so take harmony take a spray take now at unity with comprehensive motion management. That will be be driving take electric studio it is certain products that we have added also to a large extent to to install. But some of the linac projects that we may be looked at one half two years ago yes they would be on on a lower as. I don't have the specifics around those 50% what's what's with the highway space versus lower. But but we see positive trend with the products we bring into the bathroom. Thank you thank you thank you just have just maybe i'll need the last comment about the the linux with like a lower asp is it still profitable for you i'm into like to install them. I have a short answer to that question and that's yes. Yes they they are profitable those linac projects as well even though the inflation has gone up since we booked. Thank you thank you very much guys. So the time is is running can we ask only to stay two questions for the remaining persons because we have several still on the line. Thank you. The next question comes from all the rainburg from. Please go ahead. Well thanks so much for taking my question first question would be on orders. You know so 8% order decline in the first half i think there's not too much to consider from a comparison perspective. So just try it i feel it's a bit difficult to reconcile this kind of order development. Was actually the improvement of your portfolio in terms of launches unity and the update studio harmony and now it's freeze. So can you just talk to in which programs to get more traction and for which program it's probably more of a camp journey i was hoping actually normally for better auto growth on the back of this portfolio and also upgrades of harmony that you talked about in. Noah thank you oliver and a great question so if you look at the first half and look at the order growth yet it's -31 in in america is plus one in the mayan and +5 actually in in ap. I going forward with proceed italian and then. Having a good impact positive impact in thank you 3 q4. And then we'll also see the new launches having a positive impact on the unity side. Because that is a key launch i must say that with the comprehensive motion management with automatic gating those of you that have followed the lecture for a while you know that that is a kiki feature that we now bring out. To the customers that has wasted it for quite a while and that made it true different than in in canada many customer discussions as well. When it comes to harmony yes we see a good global roll out of harmony and will continue to drive that. And then i also see service and services is awesome area that we would like to see driving growth going forward. That's just a bit of of the flavor on the new products and how how they can have a positive impact in the coming quarters. And anything that works less well. Less well i'm in if you look through the full covid a situation compared to maybe when we we had a captain marcus day it's been said that over time the unit is maybe gamma knight has been a bit lower throughout the covid period. But we expect that to to pick up now. Especially with the with a display on and the new functionalities. I'm so so i think it's quite broad-based. If you take the product by product that we we see a potential for a good performance going forward. Understood thank you and then the second question just can you provide an update on your software business and how this is tracking. It's obviously the kind of highest margin part in your kind of business. You are unfortunately saying too much details but i noted that there was a change in management and i also not obviously they kind of. Lack of increased on amortized on the. Indicate that they have been certain ways i'm not choices the related to software. But if you can just talk to the development of the software portfolio please. Of course olive that's a very big question but it is the area we are investing in significantly if you've seen the ramp up of r&d over the last 1/2 years it's been software engine. And and the majority of our engineers or are driving this software growth it's both the underlying software platform that i've talked a lot about in in the last years. But now we also start to lift on new models new products on top of that. A platform and we showed some of it at the astro in in san antonio. And got great customer feedback. And we will continue to drive this software to drive both treatment planning software grow. Won't call any information system growth and informatics grow. And it is the key area for four letter. Hey going forward. It's also about going more to saturday i'm so soft dresser service deal. And that as you know it has not as much revenue growth in the first year because you have it throughout the life cycle of the product so there you have a bit of a transition from a more licensed model into more sas model. And i wouldn't gradually happen over that's a long period of time. 5 10 years. Okay thanks so much. Thank you. Next question comes from richard. Hottest banking please go ahead. All right good morning no thank you for taking my question just just one for me please so so. Are you competitive varian without with the guidance of the rabbit sharp improvement in in growth and and margin for next fiscal year looking for an almost you know 4% point. Margin improvement is that sort. Reasonable to look out for in terms of you know an electors trajectory here in. You're coming 12 months or so or how should we think about. About what we're seeing from from the competitor side. I think that's more more question to to healthy nurse and and siemens about the guidance what they are putting out then we don't have. A guidance for 40 coming years we have the midterm outlook that is the more than 7%. We see positive order tr. As i talked a lot about throughout this call. That will translate into a strong and positive revenue growth in the coming years here. But but. We're not saying any specific numbers there at the moment. The next question comes from juliet from exam pnp barreva please go ahead. Hi good morning gentlemen thanks for squeezing me in so i will put forward my two questions to the first one relate to the third quarter just making sure i got the message right. Up from where you sit today so we should expect again the older book and sales to be a negative territory in the third quarter. Before reverting back to girl from q4 onwards is that is that the way to interpret your comments. And my second question is relatively broad base but it's a quick update on your global partnership with ge. Is there any animal residence of early commercial success from that partnership. And is there any region where you are more optimistic than another in terms of the benefits that could deliver. Thank you lynn so on the third quarter i'm in ss we said we expect the challenges and some sometimes problems we've had in q2 when it comes to to the supply chains and installations to continue there. And then we expect service to continue to grow because that's kind of a recurring revenue stream. But but i think the challenge is from q2 into q3 as well. On the order order side we see. As mentioned the positive impact from from italy. The italian tender that's a significant one. And then we have positive signals from from other markets as well but it's a bit early to say so so early in the quarter here. So i think that's that's key and then one key growth driver as you mentioned julian is or or partnerships because as part of our strategy it is to have partnerships in in the cancer care ecosystems as we call it. And and having the customer sele. What imaging vendor they want where to go with our. Or linux or a products and bundled. And drive that growth i think that's a key strength of alexa and we start to see. Initial deals and we have booked this that is kind of bundling with with our imaging partners. And i expect that that share will increase going forward but it's still quite low i mean it's maybe 5ish percent of total. As we mentioned previously it has increased a bit and i will continue to do so but it's quite a slow development. Okay thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from david arlington from jp morgan please go ahead. Hi david and it's just on the medium term guidance around the margins you're talking about. You're breaking up a bit today with lyrics. David. Are you. I think we. Can yeah now we hear you get back david. Otherwise please operate it can you take the next one because we have one more in the queue and then we can come back to you david if we can solve the technical problems. So please operate to take the next one in q and then we take david after that. And we try to make it short because we have a you know we're overtime now. The next question comes from veronica to buy over from city please go ahead. I think you guys and i'll keep it to just one obviously i think. Because that would be great to understand given the cost reduction initiative said that you're putting into play. Do you think you have the installation cap. To drive the type of significant growth that you're talking about. All in installations over the next couple of minutes that would be required to hit the guidance and if so what type of investments would they require or do you think you have. The sort of capac. Today to do. Without bringing more folks. Ask me if you can walk us through how you're thinking about that in the context of the midterm. And the growth that would be required over. Next couple. Thank you. Thank you great to hear your voice again veronica and we'll come back and i would also like to say on the installation side. I think that's not where we have focused so much on the course reduction side. Because installers is driving a growth they they are installing our linux or software or unity or gamma is so. So that's an area of the organization that we have. I'm kind of protected. And you can also plan for a future revenue growth and then you can add more of that capacity going forward as well but it's very important also to work on the underlying processes to reduce the time it takes to install say a unity or lin. Add to do more of the work remotely in the training etc and we've learned a lot. Throughout covid to do things in more in the hybrid way that i also say that we can utilize going forward. I also foresee that inefficiencies that we not have any supply chain. Puts a big toll on only stores it's it's guarantine in in china it's it's longer lead times it's a multiple visits and so on. And you will get a lot of efficiency when that is stabilizing. Because of all the less shortly times less supply chain challenges. Better access to key components etc and that you can also drive more growth. If you were to see let's say double that your growth and insulation next year just for the sake of argument you think you could accommodate that with the existing salesforce or would you have to bring more people. No we could accommodate that. Okay that's very helpful thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Then operator we see if we have david again on the line and managed to reach him. It doesn't seem like it okay but we anyway are over the hours so we very much want to thank you for listening in today i'm please don't hesitate to reach out should you have any further questions later on. So wishing you a great remaining date thank you. Thank you.
