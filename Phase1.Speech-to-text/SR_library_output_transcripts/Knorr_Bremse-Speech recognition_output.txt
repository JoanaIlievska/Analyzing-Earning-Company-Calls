Dutch piece head of cvs was unfortunately unavailable to attend today as he has important meetings with our customers i do hope that you understand. Let's kick it off on channel 2 with our main messages for today. Despite many market challenges and macroeconomic headwind. Market demand in both rail and truck continues to be strong in almost all important market. In china the markets are much more caut. We are well on track with our clear action plan to fight increased input costs in both divisions. We are well on track with us we have the necessary necessary strength to face all globally economic uncertainties. Which will not disappear in the near future but we are prepared and well on the way our key points in that regard are. We drive. The 7% of our revenues out of aftermarket business. We have a rock solid balance sheet with very low debt. We are the market leader in railing truck. Our customers need solid and reliable partners like rbs and cv. That can sustain a crisis like the one we are in. We have. Two very attractive deals in digitalization well in line with our promise digital business m&a strategy and we walk the talk. We had to revise the financial year guidance recently but are well on track. To fulfill these target. One child three i would like to share our market view with you. Let me start with the rain market. We see that the underlying demand in both or e and aftermarket business continues to be high visible in a continuously very good order. We do not have any indication that it should significantly decline in the near future. Nevertheless again let me point out. Set of the race is a lumpy business which does not always go well with quarterly report. We have now seen three great quarters in a row but there might also be recall photos coming up in the future nevertheless our good or e-trend is a long term intact. Europe remains the strongest market for rbs but also north america continues to be a solid contributor. The consequences of the russian invasion in the ukraine are significant and we expect very little turnover in this country in the future that is not affected by the san. The chinese market has been characterized by a strong weakness over the past quarters with low rail car investments and economic pressures. To the ciroc overt polic. We now do not expect a significant recovery in half year too either. Overall we are confident that we will see a subsequential improvement in the global rate industry and half year two also benefiting from increasing ridership levels. In the course of the year we expect demand to remain healthy we should also be reflected in the book to build ratio about one. However supply chains have also tightened in the rail industry since last year and inflation is also clearly noticeable. The truck market also experience ongoing solid demand. Truck production rates in q2 in europe and north america develop positively year over year with a positive outlook throughout 2022 only limited. I managed all the books of our. China remains on a very weak level as expected. Supply chain situation and input cost increases are still the key concerns in the truck industry. In the coming quarters we expect that global supply chain remains challenging but we see some signs of sight improvement. In regards to pricing discussions with our customers we are well on track to compensate higher input. In the second half of the year we will be able to book the first results. I use the. Of old trucks currently drive the aftermarket business which continues develop very positive. All in all the global environment is tough but the underlying demand is robust too. Let's move to details of the second quarter on chart for. Snow plymouth generated stable revenues of around 1.7 billion euros and an operating a bit margin of 10.5% which was impacted by both divisions. Cvs posted revenues of 914 million euros at 8.1 operating margin and obvious. 823 million euros in revenues. Resulting in an operating a bit margin of 14.3%. Ethics effects supported the development on revenues and if it but did not infect it if it marching significant. Free cash flow in quarter 2 was already significantly better than quarter one but still slightly negative with 35 million euros. All the intake of 1.9 billion euros increase solidly versus prior year. Please note that the other book also benefited from an upwards adjustment of 375 million euros which does not affect the other intake. Specific existing autos like prototypes and their fixed effects etc are now included in the other book as well. Let's move to chart five. It's anticipated capex in quarter 2 with 77 million euros slightly increased the over year and quarter over quart. Still fully in line with all targets. Lots of investments on the right side were made for footprint extension in india and capacity increase of brake pads. Cvs invested among other areas in supply or tooling in europe and ap. As well as in general capacity increases in the regions outside europe. Networking capital trust is in quarter one is accepted on higher levels as current uncertain times require higher safety stock and higher flexibility to mitigate disruptions in the supply chains best pos. We have set up a clear action plan especially for the second half of the year which will lead to a reduction of the networking capital. Consequently and also additionally affected by a lower a bit contribution rosie amounted to 16.4%. Let's have a look on the divisional performance in quarter 2 starting with rbs on chart 6. All the intake of ibs was again remarkably high after too strong quota school for the 421 and quarter 122. It increased by more than 40% to 1.05 billion euros. The other book also increased by more than 35% year over year to 4.8 billion. The book to bill ratio in quarter. What's accordingly strong with 1.27. Let's move to page 7. Revenues amounted to 823 million euros a slight decrease by 3% year over year but an important improvement is anticipated versus quarter 1 by around 50 million. Obvious recall the declining sales in the oe business primarily driven by the apec reg. The aftermarket business was up 2% year over year and its share increased from 45%. 47% in quarter 2. This development is remarkable. Because many rail. Many rail operators still having a lower number of trains and service due to covid restrictions low ridership levels and the title supply chain that took its tall. China continues to face a strong rail market weakness. And the slower recovery than expected from its lock. Both visible in oe and aftermarket business. Overall chinese revenue decre. You're over year by 10%, which is much better compared to the 30% drop in the first quarter 2022. In north america. We recorded an increase in the oe and aftermarket business. We expect the sequential quarterly improvement from now on anticipant anticipate that in 2022 overall rbs revenues. Fruit grow is solidly predominantly driven by the oe business in europe and north america. Aftermarket demand should increase. Strongly depending on the development of rail traffic and travel restr. Especially in china. Operating a bit margin of obvious in for the two reached 14.3% after 18.4 a year ago. The main influencing factors on this week development was the original. With much lower profit contribution from china. In addition revenues and profits in russia where significantly lower in the last quarter. Also the input of higher inflationary cost was visible as a countermeasures will come in during the year with a certain time delay. In the remaining 6 months we expect to benefit from price increases to our customers and a slightly better development in china. Let us continue with truck on slide 8. Incoming autos of cvs amounted to 881 million which is a decline of 18% year over year. The strong decrease of the several quarters of record levels and the result of the ongoing weak chinese market. As well as component shortages on the customer side. With a consequence. Of a managed all the. Received strong underlying demand in europe and north america but oms are restrictive in taking orders from truck fleets because they have production bottleneck. Ap. Especially driven by china remains on the low level. The old book of our truck division reached 1.9 billion euros at the end of june which is remarkable increase. 516%. Book to bill in quarter 2 was at 0.96. Currently market demand is not our biggest concerned and we rate the quality of our high or the back. It's very good. Our problems. Which we share with the whole truck industry are the availability of. And the stability of supply. Let's move on to slide 9. Cvs posted 914 million euros in revenues in quarter tool which is an increase of 4% year over year and a very good result considering supply chain disrupt. And issues in china. Europe and north america. Cvs or positive development in all channel. Oe as well as aftermark. The apac region still ranges on low levels after the china six introduction last year and the additional industry slow down driven by 0 covid measures in the second quart. The utilization of fle. Continues to be high which drives demand for spare parts and services. Consequently the shelf aftermarket revenues. Increase from 25 to 27% in the last quart. In absolute terms that means aftermarket business increased by strong 30 million euros reaching 250 million euros. In the coming quarters cbs should be able to post a solid increase in revenues quarter over quart. This positive outlook depends on the global supply chain situation and somehow a catch up of truck production rates in china in the latter part of your. You call the two of this year cvs achieved in a bit of 74 million euros which is 24% lower year over year. David martin amount to 8.1%. Compared to 11.2 a year ago. This marching development was highly affected by the lower contribution from china as well as russia. In addition cost pressure from inflation and supply chain headwinds to get stall. Cvs concluded price negotiations with many customers already. Major benefits from this negotiations will be reflected in improved margins in the second half of the year. Let's move on to top 10. The impacts of the russian war in ukraine and ignore premises previously announced withdrawal from business in russia resulted in a meaningful adjustment of the guidance as communicated on july 27th. I would direct exposure in russia on a full year basis amounts up to 200 million euros in reven. Of which we expect to lose roughly 130 million euros this year. On the mulch inside and on group level we expect to lose roughly 70 basis points on canal ramsey group level. The withdrawal from russian activities resulted in non-operating and non-cash expenses of 18 million euros which is reflecting a right off of inventory. Additionally we have a deep consideration effect of 9 million eur. For the kb comma show adventure in our financial result. There could be an additional non cash relevant maximum. Of additional up to 32 million euros for accounts receivable. Based on our calculations. Sof. We have not faced any payment defaults though. Currently we only fulfill existing contracts as long as they are not impacted by sanctions and we are not generating new businesses in russia. Let's move to page 11. Chinese railing track mark is currently faced strong head. The recovery. After their street lockdowns is sluggish and puts companies. Active in china and around the world in challenging situ. Snow blender is not an except. On the right side. 2021 had already seen a certain market downswing in metro. Fueled by a tougher environment in real estate which is an important basis for the funding infrastructure investment. And high-speed due to ongoing low ridership. Looking into 2022. Rolling stock fig. Arrange even below 2021. Obvious is designed in the current platforms in metro and high. But with the lower number of produced rail cars we sell less kb products. So please let me be clear. It's not about market share losses which led to lower revenues. We are fully in line in this year regarding market share development in metro. And we are stable in high speed. Regarding market recovery we only expect very little progress in the second half of this. Truck production rates are also affected by a strong decrease of the chinese market after the china six introduction july 2021. The additional hit from the zero covid policy takes its tall resulting in half field. I feel one tpr of about 1/3 compared to the first half of last. Until. We expect. Only some recovery of truck production rates in china and consider 720,. $25,000 in our full year guid. One important strength of our business is the outperform. Of underlying market. This was again the case in china in the first half of 2022. Let's move to page 12. To fight inflationary headwinds we have to find the clear action path that is already being implemented. First by a price negotiations and seconds while our group-wide profit and cash protection program. I'll. You still upset all inflationary headwind. Which is unchanged despite the fact that we now expect those to be around 300 million euros for the full year 2022. We plan to compensate around 2:30 of these headwinds via price increases to our customers and around the third why all of the. Really focusing here on own cost and efficiency. A quick update on the ongoing price negoti. We have already achieved good results with our aftermarket customers in both div. This is also the case. With several of our major oe customers in truck. The rate industry is a more difficult natur. We finished important negotiations successfully already. First effects will be visible in the second half of 2022 while some benefits will spill over even into 2023 due to longer cycle. Cycles of contracts and binding durations of price diving. Let's move to page 13. I've included this night to give you transparency on all the headwinds we are currently facing. And their impact on our outlook for this. China is a clear. The before mentioned the market weakness. Much lower volumes in both the rail and the truck market should lead to a burden of roughly 120 basis points in avid margin this year. In addition. The the impact from the lost russian business reduces our operating a bit margin by 70 bas. The good news is that with all our strong efforts of our profit and cash protection program we are confident to compensate all the remaining headwinds in a nutshell. Also the quite high level in regards to the degree of implementation for the measures underlines that conf. That clearly shows the strength of no problem. We therefore as a result of all that being said moderately. Expect moderately higher profitability in the second half of 2022. Resulting in a group operating guidance of 10.5. To 12% for julio 2022. On top 14. We confirm the revised operating guidance for 2022 given on july 27th. We increase the lower end of our revenue guidance. And now expect revenues between 6.9 to 7.2 billion euros. An operating a bit margin between 10.5 and 12%. And free cash flow between $300 and 500 million euros for 2022. Please note that this guidance is based on the assumptions outlined on the right side of page 14. Let's finish with an update on rbs china and recent m&a activ. On page 15. We explained that our cmd last year that we have a clear two pillow strategy going forward first we want to leverage our existing. Strong market positions in both divisions to grow and secure our existing car business fields. We want to leverage our strong foundation and expand into new growth markets of digital businesses. Following the strong underlying mark mega trends both organically but also via expositions and partn. Let me outline of the s development in china and what we expect in the years ahead on chart 16 for our core business. Revenues declined since peak levels in 2014-15. Despite significant market investment. Driven by market share losses in high speed as expected. In the last. 2 years also covid took its. And despite rather stable market shells lower market investments could not be overcompensated. We believe. Infrastructure investments will continue in the coming years. Which definitely will. To new rail vehic. On top rail traffic should improve from the low levels eventually. Even though it is currently difficult to. When this will exactly be. Therefore we expect aftermarket revenues to increase again in the future and crc's ambition to expand abroad is an opportunity. Over. We expect slight market share losses in metro. In the next couple of years while high-speed market share should remain rather. Nevertheless be expect obvious says to continue to decline slightly. But we see a level of around 600 million euro as a sustainable floor. With that floor that we currently see we expect the aftermarket share to increase daily. Also profitability will reduce over time. So. What do we do in china. We are expanding our aftermarket footprint there. We started an efficiency program on the pcpp. To move the organization from growth to sustainably lower fixed cost. We are doing everything we can to remain the innovation and quality leader in china. China is still a great business for programs just not the big gross driver anymore. But china will stay a meaningful contributor to kb's profits and cash fl. Regarding growth we see more opportunities in other regions especially europe and north america and we will exploit those. In addition we are working on other profitable segments in rail which should be able to partially compensate the expected development in china of particular interest cr. Freight seikman digital coupling and digitalization in the aftermarket. Please move to slide 17. In july we announced the acquisition of coachelli which will strengthen the cvs aftermarket and digital business. With highly accretive mar. Coachella is the world leader. Developing and manufacturing of child test diagnostics. The multibrand diagnostic system for commercial and other vehicle types in the aftermark. We are strengthening our existing aftermarket business by investing in a commercial vehicle. Specific diagnostic solution that will open up new business opportunities for us. In the fields of big data and predictive maintenance maintenance based on big data. Cvs aftermarket revenue share will expand by approximately 150 basis. Let's have a look on our next investment on page 18. We have concluded a comprehensive cooperation agreement and became largest child of next year actually. Enabling rb. To make fool use of nexus sensor technology and data ecosystem. Once obvious break stores h. Sanitary and other systems are connected. With nexus digital ecosystem we will be able to generate data. This information will enable. To set up new business models increasing vehicle availability optimized life cycle costs and greater operational efficiency. I would like to thank all colleagues employees business partners and customers for their tremendous efforts in this challenging quarter and times. And with. I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin the q&a session with my colleague. Thank you. Thank you. If you would like to ask a question. Please signal by pressing. Star. On your telephone keypad. If you're using. Speakerphone. Please make sure your mute function. Turned off. To allow your signal. Reach our. I can. Star. To ask a question. Just a moment. To allow everyone an opportunity. Testicle for. We will take her first question. From. Fire from up. Please go ahead. Yes thank you and good afternoon. The first question is just to follow up on the slide number 16 on the china outlook. And i was just wondering. Because he's assume another decline there is it that you assume that the. Current situation which is highly impacted by the. Zero covert strategy will actually last until 2025. And will only get better afterwards. What is it really that you know the loss of market share the autonomous policy impact. Actually counter weighs a market recovery that we could potentially see out for this. That's the first one thank you. Yeah. It's you're going to let me. Answer that question. We currently see actually due to covet and also the. Savings measures. The china rate system is. It's facing. That we believe and that is also a little bit different from what we are we saw the world in china. In the last fall. For the next few years actually and even into 2025. We do believe that on the metro side. The number of cars that are going to be produced and being sent into the market will be largely reduced i mean we had a number. That we assumed before. Which is all based on on direct customer feedback or so it's not just numbers that we pick. Where we where we were considering like more than 7,000 vehicles per year. Are we now believe that in the next few years we are more facing like 5,000 metrocards per year. So the market is really going down. And also in the high speed side. So we were assuming numbers that are more like 180 to 200 trains a year. And where is again this year. We are looking at more. 60 out of which. Like 30 trains are ordered right now and that situation we believe. I will slightly recover but last for. The next few years and that's why we also believe that. Quick recovery because of that in the oe business is is not that likely. And that is reflected in the chart. 16 long-term. It is that the market will grow again we believe that. But also then the impact out of the autonomous policy. I will then come into place. And therefore those numbers that you see on on a page 16 i derived from that consideration. Okay thank you jordan and maybe if i may follow up on how does. It's kind of a new thinking compared to the fallout theater. Impact your thinking around the the midterm arts and target for obvious that you have seen at 18 to 19 and 1/2%. Invested also have a structurally negative impact or. Are you confident that you can. You know compensate that with. Did the other opportunities where i guess some of them are more. You know wait until the end of the decade i guess so. I guess probably hard to to achieve that target without the china contribution. Yeah thanks been. Hello clear question i mean. Solitaire really looking at this so today china impact and and. Leave alone for a second all the other opportunities outside china that we would be having clear that the midterm guidance would look more. So to say aspirational for us to achieve just looking at this effect solely. But i think as i head in my statement already mentioned we do have other opportunities and jordan has other opportunities. Not only in europe but also in other parts of the world with the digital coupler potential business freight markets developing a potentially a better than we expected last year so other opportunities out there as well on day aftermarket side so taking this into consideration should at least be able to partly. Partially offset this effect and we're still working on additional measures to go even further but. Maybe some additions by you again happy to. I mean the the you're right with your assumption of course if if the china business goes down to a certain extent as we if we also stated on slide 16 that will hurt us to a certain extent. The challenge will be and there is opportunities out there to. Let's say compensate this rather. It's a higher margin business compared to margins that we make another parts of the word. And with other business that is also of high margin. And that we need to consider also our portfolio. In the next few years how we streamline that. And we need to consider just the situation that they're in the decoupling word. And where the chinese market will get more and more independent maybe also harder to control for us. It's reflected in our numbers that we showed there. I already. That we find to other opportunities in our core markets whether it's europe especially also north america. Considering out portfolio organically and also inorganically. In order to basically compensate for that and i think there is opportunities out there that we. Very close looking. Frank already mentioned for example digital business. Also our exposition with next year it will help long-term. Is that is clear we will accelerate with that with that a share that we bought. In the corporation agreement. That we have made their our digital business. By about 2 years because we have access to a scalable cloud services there. I'm in the smart way basically evaluate a data generated additional business model. We clearly have plans to grow there faster than we could without that that is very important. And that goes into basically digital automatic couplers and fre. And all the business that comes with that whether that is automatic brake test. I wish i will lead to quite a bit of efficiency improvement in the. In the sector. And we can without part for you i think largely. Participate in that and that that is a few examples and there's other. I hope we were in the future compensate for indeed. And more difficult getting more difficult situation in china. No end and spend one last edition because also you mentioned a closer look at our portfolio as well. Keep. At investment we have also not considered when we talked about the cmd midterm targets back then in november of last year with that accret. Of a mountain. Effect that we would have all of that that is another countermeasure. When again i think about 2025 that with the girls opportunities you have and you know the good order intake also this year. Maybe there's a chance one is more on the upper end of the revenue range but towards the lower and then. Because of it looks better. That looks fine i i would i would say still some sometime so to say to go and of course we we are currently in in some of 2022 we do our regular in. Planning processes the next one is upcom. Full time of this year as you know every kind of full-time. And we will let you know as soon as we would feel comfortable to guide you in that direction so. If it's okay for you to spend. Okay absolutely thank you frank and the the other question i just had was on. Moving to to because we have i think 8:00 or 9 people in the queue. And if you also give them some rooms to spend sorry for that. If that's okay. Let me move to our. From benue from morgan stan. Please go ahead. Oh i could get afternoon and thank you for taking the questions i had a couple i really wanted to understand the high level thinking about some of the comments. I'm on slide 16. And you you made the point and i understand what you're saying about potential. Potentially losing a bit of market share in in metro. But could you could you tell. What. How you're thinking about that is this just a general comment about autonomous policy or is it something more specific that you've actually seen or are seeing in the market because obviously. And the. The the market share issue in high speed. His arguably been pretty pretty significant over time. So so can you just walk us through that please. Yeah sure. Sure ben i i will try to do that then. In a few sentences i mean. If you put it into the context of a high speed. Maybe it's good it's a good since you're also hinted at that. Maybe that's a good compar. Actually because there might be similarities but they also. Nuclear differences between those two market segments and i want to wanted to point out both maybe. First of all high speed. I saw a real boom in the years 14 15 16 so to say because of. It was this ketchup needed after that accident if you remember. In 2011. And back then the chinese car build. Had to deliver so quickly large number of high speed trains that they said okay. Let's take that western technology that is out there and let's. Not look too closely even at the well maybe i say that a little slowly at the prices that they charge us. We need to get it done it was kind of what the overall spirit was there and we largely. Benefited from that during those years. And then after those years starting in 16 17 18. They said let's we don't want to have western technology all over the place for the next few decades we want to develop our own platforms and they did that very rapidly you could say. And western companies like us did not really. Supply. Systems complet. Let's say brake systems anymore but drive the components which we are doing up to until today. Because we have our local joint ventures in in china there but our overall market share declined in high speed. And basically that was not really. I realized if you just looked at our numbers because at the same time the market for. Metros was largely increasing during that time and therefore. And without high market share metros that was kind of overcompensating now in metro's obviously they want to do something similar they want to also go into their own platforms. I wish i kind of on the way but this process is very different from doing it at high speed because the metro decision and the buying decision at metros is. That being done much more locally than the central buying behavior on on high speed. And for that reason. I'm really first of all it takes much longer and second of all we believe that we will lose some market share because of that but we also see currently this despite the fact that those platforms are already. Ad. And that in the real buying behavior we are still in those metros that's also why frank said. That we did not lose a lot of market share recently but we expect. To lose some of the market share but we expected over the course of the next year we still stay in the 40% range of the market share with metro business considering all of the development. That seems to be very reasonable of course we also just ourselves to a certain extent locally. Because we are resync a little bit of sage channels to make them even a little bit more local with local partners. And that are all measures to be taken in order to secure a lower market share from today and this lower market share than what we have today in metro is reflected in those numbers on slide 16. That's that's extremely helpful i i understand the the how you're thinking about it. The second question and i'll count off then is just around. Your comments about slightly lower profitability. If if i go back to the time of the ipl or even before and i think about where profits are now and we don't obviously have your margins but. I would have seen your margins have come down quite significantly in china over that period of time. I. You coming that we're going to see slightly lower profitability are you basically saying that we're 80% of the way through the margin downdraft. Or could we continue to say. I don't got an ongoing significant margin pressure yeah low to mid single digit margin deterioration in china so just just calibrate that. Low profitability common place. I would i would say. Imagine. Development. In china over the last few years. Not significant. Down it was moder. And at most they're supposed to say. What we what we have to what we have to consider to a certain extent for the future is. The. I mean the assumptions also fear that the margins in in china in the past were higher than in other regions yeah that's what we having this discussion actually rightfully so. And we will we will see. Over the. Off time of the next whatever 8 years until 2030 or something like that. That those prices and the margins that be able to be achieved in in china. Welcome closer to where it is in the rest of the world i mean. There's no other. Reason to assume that in the long run with. The chinese technology becoming more independent. That you can you can basically. Assume that are those prices always stay at the level like we had in the last decade there's the receive those trends already. And they will continue a little bit. So asymptotically so to say they will move closer. To price levels where we see it in the rest of the world they won't crash or anything like that that's not going to happen but they will move closer coming from. 11. Still today. All right here at some subsistence maybe a little high. And and that is what we mean by some of the margins will be adjusted also in the future. And when when we said. That we will see some volume loss because of the reasons that have been stated before and some margins lost because of what i just said now that is what i meant before we need to now look into our portfolio and in our core markets also in europe and north america. Let's see how can we what portfolio elements are there how can we replace that in in the in the mid to long term and that is the charge we were doing there some opportunities there that we go out. Anderson an additional example then we talked in the past also in the aftermarket business for example in china that with the start of the covid situation that was also kind of a normalization of some effects on going like extension of maintenance. Chinese development more. Let's take out the kind of normalization towards the global rest of the world levels and this is i think normalization is really the key point. Maintenance cycle absolutely right like you can imagine that. When in the middle of the last century. A dec. Everybody was selling those. Also that restaurant technology not only. But the maintenance cycle that went with it in the description of it. Of course they were somewhat aggressive and on the safe side. In order to generate the amount of aftermarket business and the chinese. Do globe benchmarking and they adjusted here and. And you know maintenance circuits will be stre. I understand that thank you very much logan and and frank and i'll pass it on to my colleagues. Question. Coming from ingo soccer from b&b party. Please go ahead. Thanks for taking the question and also. Thanks for providing the additional transparency on a lot of the china numbers and consider for being available for this questions and. I'm just to understand the 2025 revenue expectations like 16 of it better i think you had already explained and responses went to question it's based on the. Metro units for. But it's a compared to 2022 rather than your capital markets i think this year you're probably at 4,000 on the metro side. So if i understand you correctly and just want to make sure that's correct you do expect a higher market volume on metro as well as high speed in 2025 compared to this year. So that the revenue decline would be the market share erosion and pricing primarily. And in the context of also be curious to know whether you can tell us what your comprehensive. Plan behind this what's given terms of the shelf not break revenues that you've included in your numbers roughly with expected more than the majority of. The revenues in china to be generated as non-break products by a 20. Well we have this year we have more or less in the metro side let's say. More towards 5,000 that we expect. In the metrocards which is still very very different from what we've seen in the in the past years we were. Between 7:00 and 7,5. So until 2025 yeah without numbers we are a little bit on the. On the side that you're saying this will continue for the next years yeah. If not if there might be some uptick yeah because of covid will be now. And and more investments will come that might be some upset opportunity but we don't assume that right now. On the high-speed. We assume that the market will grow. Auntie 2015. From the level how we see this year and even how it was last year this year we see even a lower market than last. Exceptionally low on the. So they are right there's to make sure then until 2025 that metro mallet flat i speed growing a little bit. Then also market share lost a little. And in the overall. You see those numbers. And on the shelf numb break products with the majority of revenues in 2013. No we will especially with the aftermarket business. That is very heavy on the bright side we will still have the majority in china on the bright side not on the non-bike side. Okay thanks and then a quick phone on the pricing that you mentioned that on the east side of the way it's difficult for you to on the current contracts pass through the high input cost can you come in a bit on whether you're. Contracts have changed our changing with a under a new designs of contracts you are now on a better position to pass through the input cost also on longer term railroad contracts or are you still say stuck with similar pricing mechanism so that you've had before. The current period of concentration. You mean in china or generally. Dollar general. Because you said it's not different than china with what i said before in china it will be much more difficult to pass it on because of the overall situation that we have there. In in terms of the rest of the world and especially in europe. We need to. Differentiate really between aftermarket business where we have. The better opportunity to increase prices also short-term which we did already this year. In in terms of the contracts that we are doing newly now of course we are looking at that we have. A price input price escalation classes we had that to a certain extent also in the past yeah that was not uncommon in the rail industry. It is important to note. That even though we might have had that in the contracts to a certain share in the past. Is there the language in the contract is very often and that is also usual. That at the end of the contract or at the end of the year in this case. It will be reassessed according to those indices and there will be a a negotiation again how much of those indices return into higher prices. So that is why we have a little bit of a delayed. But towards your question are we considering that especially as a new contracts absolutely yes. Okay thank you. Thank you. We will take our. From. From jp morgan. Please go ahead. Is hybrid afternoon everybody and thanks for your time. My first one is also in china and maybe i wanted to understand. Who are the companies that are gaining share against you can you provide some color on that. And specifically i want to know if there is a risk that some of these companies might try to. Coming europe and us market and regain some or try to gain some share. In the season and how comfortable you are. This is just a china issue and and should be contained in there. I mean first of all there is a an effort going on since many years to be honest. And the process was kind of slow but now. Maybe a little bit accelerating. That those local providers. High tide and other. That they are consolidated more or less into a specific division of crc. And those are basically then. The the competition there. In the especially also in the brakes market their spacing a component section that. Targeted to be formed so to say within crc. To watch your question. International competition. Well. You know. In in in 10 years ago or 15 years ago. Everybody was saying okay the chinese will come into europe into north america everywhere. It happened to a much lesser extent. Then what was expected back then. I'm has certainly something to do with the conservatism of the operators in those countries they. Not really open for let's say experiments and say i don't know how this technically will really work out. And we see that especially north america there was what's the time a few years ago when in the metro business. The clc company was offering more and more in winning some bits that had been declining since then because of the let's say a policy. With within. Within the us. And. And in europe it also has largely not happened what we have never. So far. Set those break. Advise them. What go into western car build. A chinese brakes and distribute at the north america or in europe. And if we see that occasionally. On let's say hvac systems or door systems but never on safety critical bread and butter business. Forest bik. Thank you and my second question is for frank on energy crisis in europe. Maybe if you can talk through an energy intensity of your business and reliance on gas. And how you're preparing the company for the shortage that are looming ahead of us. And and and maybe any color you can provide on the supply chain side that are there any part of supply chain. That could be more at risk from the current energy situation in europe. I think soccer i mean first of all we are of the clear opinion. The the biggest. That would potentially come out of such a scenario would be on the secondary effect. Basically custom. Being. And then that. Customers can't produce anymore and we would then also be not supplying in such a situation to our customers anymore or in our supply chain if some of our tier 2 to 324. Suppliers would be hit we would face significant difficult. Our own business. We are not that virtually integrated that we would have a tremendous dependency on on gas supply for our production. Sweet look for example at that munich overall plant we don't consume more than 10,. A kilowatt hours. A year so we we are pretty so to say. Due to that given vertical integration. And also the global spread of our business which is basically a local for local business. Not so much of affected. We have set up a task force since i think on the meantime nearly quite 2 months. That in order to cope with that situation and to figure out and basically. Elaborate with all the stakeholders in the company. Basically on the procurement side. What the dependency of our suppliers is all about and we are screening those suppliers we are having sent out the questionnaire. To them in order to identify where we would have potential ris. Over overall. At youtube the business structure that we have. Extreme high local for local content in the respective countries and that widespread decentralized business. We don't have so much so to say the dependency on that but the big hit could come in such a worst case scenario on the customer and our own supply chain side. Thank you. Our next question. Is. Direct me. Please go ahead. Thanks very much everyone thanks for taking my questions i had another question on flight 16 if i may. Just a follow-up really i'm you touched on the aftermarket and lengthening a cycles. Could i just check is there any assumption here about loss of share in aftermarket for example in sourcing. Hi chinese customers on the aftermarket. And if you could maybe. Indicate roughly where the aftermarket share in china reaches by the end of the decade thank you. We believe that. The aftermarket business is i mean in terms of market share right now we see that the market. Aftermarket because of the lowridership of course currently. Suffering a little bit. But we believe that the that we have opportunities. And in terms of our share of wall. And in terms of aftermarket business so at the end of the decade. We believe that the majority. Of those 700 million that you see here will be aftermarket. Rather than oe and that means that aftermarket share then in terms of our revenue. It's higher than 50% which. Like remarkable. Considering our overall aftermarket share that is currently between 45 and 47% depending on. What there is your look look at. That is what we believe that the anchor point and also a stable point in this business in china we don't see. It is largely replaced by local competition. Thank you if i may a quick question on trucks as well. So just you mentioned earlier in the presentation that your main problem is. Is not on demand right now it's on the supply. Given that this is a cyclical business as you monitor the macro how are you thinking. Any potential cyclical ris. Into maybe 2023 or 2024 thank you. Yeah thanks for the question i mean we do still see a sol. Demand out there currently in europe and in north america and we assume that also to last for quite some time still we see that. The demand out there in the market. Is significantly higher than what the production capabilities of the oems are currently represent. Needless to say we said since also quite some months that we off of course always have to watch carefully. If there might be also a certain overheating coming up in the future but we don't see it currently coming of course we have in in north america over the next years or so some greenhouse gas emission regulations that would kick in in. 234. Ahead from now and we have to watch their carefully some pre-buy or whatever effect in the market. Yeah but we still still see that the situation. Rather solid three also see that in europe for example the average age for fleet truck. That is quite sol. At 11:00 so no indications yet that anything with their significantly happen to the demand side. Thank you very much. You're welcome. We will take. From william mackey from kepler sugar. Please go ahead. Hello good afternoon and thank you very much for the time and for all of the detailed insights. My first i just like a clarification at first if you could. I'm between slides 13 and 16. Just staying with 16 and all the. In china. Numerically could you share what your previous assumptions were for the revenues through your midterm planning from 22. True to 25. Compared to the projections you put on to slide 16. That would be the first and then coming back to to the comments about the midterm. Margin expectations again. You know i guess the mathematically the full year drop out effects of russia which was not known at the cmd is an over 100 basis points. And from what you're suggesting the mathematical impact of. The china drop out is another 100 basis points on the margin so. I guess i'm just asking for clarification on how you can compensate for that. To come even close to the current midterm 2025 margin objectives. So that's the clarification. Please. Yeah thanks but let me take over that one first of all i mean as we have been presenting our capital market day guidance for 20-25. In november of last year you can already somehow see that we were actually at that time well aware of how 2021 figures will end up so to save of definitely can be assured that we have not appointed towards the future on the basis of something like an average 2015 to 2020. If i'd rather looked already so to say into 2021 and already some clouds on the horizon in regards to china please forgive me if i are not detail out now all the quantitative ingredients of the midterm guidance. But it was definitely a higher than so to say. The 600 that we are currently seeing now looking at 21 actuals that's the first point the second. That is so to say you are fully right in regards to russia. That so to say needs was not baked in clearly. Same is true that what i just talked before and regards to the china situation but if we also young and myself just outlined some 10 minutes ago we do see other potential opportunities in order to compensate best possible for for this potential shortfalls in the outlook one is for example also that the china impact is also that high and also the russian impact on the mountains. But also that the most recent china reductions that we see so what you see reflected in the martian and impact is a contribution margin loss to a large extent and fixed structures at the same time couldn't be reduced in the similar amount. So did we do expect of course once we now have to face a certain reduced growth over time or rather stable revenue development in future that we also have to look into our fixed cost structure in in both markets clearly going into the future. That should make that margin effect not that high that it ultimately is now interested solitary effect. Second point is also that i mentioned before for examp. I'll be discussed about the key. Effect on our business in quarter one already in may when we set together. And we also said that there will be a significant so today acceleration effect at least on the equation effect sorry not acceleration equation. In a rated as well due to that cannot fully compensate china that is clear but at least those are some indications already in addition to the business ones that you haven't mentioned beforehand with a digital businesses the coupling etc. Definitely they are still at the opportunities out there and you can be sure that we give at. In order to do so. Thank you very much my actual. Question would come to pricing. Could you use differentiated between your ability to price up in aftermarket. Compared to oe and then also differentiated between the segments and some customers. Across the oe customer universe but could you at least throw some color on the level of price inflation or pricing you are able to achieve quantitatively between aftermarket and oe and to what extent it is really mitigating or offsetting. The the friction or rather the headwind caused by the input cost inflation that you're experiencing. Yeah sure the. First of all i would say. Mitch midterm. Midter. We will. Bully compensate. Best price increases we will not be the ones. Who are stuck in the middle. Between higher input prices and basically. The prices that we chester. Oh. And then i'm totally convinced of because our business model is a search that we can that we can do that. In the short term. Though there is a little bit of a delay. How we can tackle that because. When when it now comes to existing. Running cont. Some of which. I might have some price adjustment closes that we can pull towards the end of those contracts. And others there's also few that might not have. Those classes so they don't have those closes. And those project contracts are as such that. Does clear agreements with our customers. We have to deliver x amount of. Something. Over a certain time frame. And we can potentially adjust if we have those classes at the end of those contracts. But with some it will be more difficult. But over time we will of course get new contracts and i'm totally convinced of that we can defend our gross margins that we had in the past. With that because that is also goes to the buyers of vehicles. They will need to pay more in the future for those trains there's no question in my mind. And and therefore we will be able to pass through. That imp. That is a little bit of the dynamic and of course on the aftermarket side we can add much quicker. And that's also what we are doing and pulling every opportunity to to do that. Which we also have done it during this year. So that is kind of my view on it. And we can assume that through next year beginning of over next year so we will be able to recover. Those. Thank you again thank you frank. You're welcome. Our next. Comes from calvin chen on credit. Please go ahead. I'm high. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So much details. I'm how you're able to. Compensates. Profit. I'm. I've got to follow up question on that actually on teacherization as you mentioned it being one of the key areas that you'll be looking at so could you give us a little bit more color on. How the actual monetization will be there cuz you mentioned specifically that you're able to set up some new business models. And your clients are able to can have higher operational efficiency and also in terms of the penetration rate of this digitization offerings in the future. Do you expect that to grow. At what speed given that you mentioned some of your operator customers are very relatively conservative in terms of. You think i'm digitization offerings. Thank you very much. Sure let me try to to put to shed some light on that. First of. You are quite right. Digitalization especially in the rail industry. I mean sometimes if i listen to to what is written in the price and things like that. There's opinions out there this is absolutely necessary which is true i agree with that. And it goes very quickly now it's industry is rather conservative and. The speed of it is somewhat limited although i'm. Convinced that it will. Because it will be it would be necessary. The the benefits for the customer out of. We're not when i'm concerned with our product portfolio. It's really on the one hand side lower operational. Because. We cannot only do condition based maintenance with smarter subsystems that we have. And i refer to that in a minute or in a second. How this is going to be supported with our share with next year. But it's also basically preventive maintenance. That we can foster with that. And by the way with data that we collect. That also maybe out of the environment. Off of the train and especially of the infrastructure we can generate additional. Business model. In order to generate a benefit for the customer what what we have done with. The share next year and especially with the corporation agreement that we have with next year. Is that we are able now. About. 100 to 150. And yeah that we throw into the market. With this next year system to upload. Data that we collect from our systems into the cloud this cloud is scalable yeah the scalable to. To an extent that we don't have real limits to do so. And we have in the market about a million 1.5 million existing assets that over time we can also. Towards the system. And and and and therefore we have an infrastructure. That we can generate an interface to to our customers so. It is it is it is much easier. To make recommendation also on maintenance cost savings to our customers. In terms of maintenance regim. Bedroom. Play that girl that was also the other part of your question. Well you know. This will not explode over the course of the next year. We are we are having a small amount of digital business right now. But we believe that over the course of the next let's say 4 to 5 years. We can generate a couple of hundred million. Business out of. Which is rather high margin business and it's one of those. Let's say elements. That is helpful to compensate for high margin russian and china business that might decline a little bit but it's one of those. Sure i think thank you very much if i made it to squeeze in very last quick one i'm on the truck in specifically as you share a lot on china but could you. If there's a bit more color on the us market grow. I'm inside. Especially for 2023 that will be very helpful thank you very much. Yeah of course kevin i mean let me first start before looking into 23 so what we expect for for 2022 is currently a truck production rate. 550 5,000 vehicles so to. For america's only out of that is 400,000 is the current market expectation for north america. Which is a more than 10% growth compared to what we have seen last year so the market is as i said quite rock solid. And for next year. Delete last expectations that we have considered even the slide growth towards the year after so maybe another. 04. A percentage points of clothes. Yeah that we should be able to see. Then in 23. But that's very helpful thank you very much for the time. You're welcome. Next question. Is that from. Please go ahead. Hello and happy friday i'm afraid of. Small question left for me. Just clarify if you. Incorporate any revenues from the digital automatic coupling in the 255 guidance of whatever revenues. Took some that is on. Will only happen after. Oh yes i mean i can i can share that with you i mean what we have done is. We. You know the digital automatic coupler in the front business is. Of course. Something that i'm convinced of it will come over the next years and until the end of the decade because just for the simple reason. Just for the simple reason that the ray freight business in in europe. It's not sustainable and cannot really i would almost say. Survive compared to answering the cost structures compared to let's say other means of transportation if that does not come. And it is the absolute political will. That. Afraid of would go into rail. And if that goal is not completely question then it needs to come that's why i believe this is the time that it will come. And what we have done in our planning in the past we have. I considered that scenario and then we have taken a good chunk out of it because we're saying okay there's of course. Conservatism and their probability that it still might not come. And we have taken a chunk out of it again. And so there's a portion of it. Is included and a portion of that is not included if it comes because it's kind of a black and white. A black and white consideration. Okay. But long answer so. Yes or no fashioned so there's some some consideration for the 2015. Take. From. Escape from bank of america. Please go ahead. Candyman good afternoon and thank you so much for spending time and explaining all those. For change i'll ask you a question on your flight. Which is detailing the negative impact from russ. I mean it's 70 million years if it's kids versus original guys. It looks like the contribution march is a very high there and that effectively would suggest to me that russia is lost making for you this year. Can you confirm that can you give us an id if it's not making carlos making it. And then what question you could take so. Either like complete the cultivating yourself or just assume the region this is not losing money anymore so that's. Outside thank you thank you very much. First first type of pieces is absolutely correct it's a very creative margin or has been a very creative marching business forensically number two. I'll be here baby behind china. As a very very good market with strong contribution margins and also over all good good if it's a second hypothesis is not correct it's we. We think that. For the quarter 2:45. Which are the ones that are affected by the the war for the one was not really affected but the three other quarters have been affected we expect somehow around 0. Overall i'm at least a single. The single digit million a bit out of the remaining business towards here and that's all but not lost making. And the the measures of course i mean first of all. Condom message that we have been taking was first 30 consolidation of the transmission resulted to adventure end of may. To the the joint ventral parties. And that basically takes out complete fixed. Out of the system. No problem it's it's much more difficult for example on the on the right side we have reduced in the meantime nearly a hundred people. How to follow locations in russia and potentially more to come. And. So according to that you do have of course certain divas to counter steel. Contribution martin law. Thanks very much fun that's all clear and very quickly on cash flow you still have a pretty wide range for the full year guidance and that's my last one thank you very much. Yeah you will come for of course somehow if a free cash flow is is always also fueled by the quality of earnings that you would have in the p&s but it's of course depends on the if it as well as it does depend. On the usage of assets or the increase of acid so working capital is the second determinant. And that's why this ranges is rather pick up because it has two ingredients who who are in themselves kind of volatile that is the reason for the radar a bigger range and i would say. If if we come in line somehow with our a bit margin. Does the target for the full. And if we get our plans to reduce working capital especially inventories i have to admit. But also getting the cash in for accounts receivable but mainly inventories then we should also be rather in the mid-r. If also. Times like these some of the customers decide not to pay to was here and which you're not really. But you can't really force them into paying. Then we would be rather on the lower side of the guidance if all payments completely come in as they would be contractually obliged. Then we could even be higher. So to say. That's great freddy and good luck. Tell you about to come thank you very much. For the best wishes. Thank you. Question. Lor. From bar. Please go ahead. Thank you very much i just want you to follow up. On what you said on the l. How long till marching so if i put like everything together. The dilution from the effects coming in china metro. Autonomous policy and so on and so forth plus russia. On the one side the equity effects from the digitalization of a range digital couples and so on and so forth. How how would you think right now. Augustus the guidance the truck provided for 7.5 or 18 to 19 and a half percent. But you don't even mind that you have called that aspirational so. Would you come see the rather the high end to be aspirational or also the low end. The first of all that thanks if you did for your question. I. It's it's always so to say much much simpl. Add to talking long-term to think maybe of about mid. The midpoints of the guidance i think that that helps it a lot big i think it's too much too early to 2-3 years ahead. Else time to already discuss about potential levels for the upper end or the lower end. Every cardinal regarding all the uncertainty that. Still in in the years to come and given a potentially reduced starting point as we are seeing it currently in 2022 so please forgive us that. No not refer really to the to the range elements of 2025 a year as we are still in in 2022 with certain uncertainties. Thank you. Yeah i think you'll feel. We'll take our next question. From phillip taylor from deutsche bank. Please go ahead. Yes good afternoon and and thank you for for taking all the questions if i may just coming back on that last question if i can maybe ask it a slightly different way you talked a couple of times about the potential opportunities to recover the impact of the negative impact on the margin could you maybe give us a sense of how much of those opportunities are cost focused versus revenue growth focused that will be my first question please. Yeah i mean it's just summarizing but doing it might have had said in the last hour. I would send and adding the knowledge of what we talk about on a regular basis and also upcoming in the next planning process on cost potential. That i would say we basically talk business opportunities to a large extent so 70 80% i would say if you need a quantitative. A kind of french i would say it's about business opportunities and revenue gains with the relevant contribution margin. And the minor is is cost impacts but as i said before we have to do something in certain markets to to further also create cost potentials going forward so 70 80 to 2030 i would say. Maybe the balance. Thanks thank you i'm just second quick clarification regarding the initiatives to recover the inflationary edwins do you expect those to be fully recovered by the end of 23 hopefully in back in. The margin by 2023. Not sure whether i fully understood. Question you can you maybe the inflationary pressures you talked about you expect i think a significant amount will come by. Price increases and the rest with. Cost measures with your your customers getting i guess other. Revenue cost measures. Do you expect that all to. Concluded and and in in the achieved by 2023. By the end of this year it's in time for 2023. No no i don't think so but also inflation i think the end is not reached by and 2022 now so we still see on the inflation side not the full impact of what's currently on ongoing if i make just one example is like an energy cost like electricity or even gas. We do have contracts we feel pretty safe in regards that we know exactly what's in the 300 million for 2022 but we already know that now know that for 2023 we see an additional. Feel over you out of electricity and out of gas for example so they continuous effort still needed in 2023 to achieve that exactly the same result that somehow we have done this year but additionally also a further price measures will kick in then in 2023. I'm also cle. So i don't think that it's. It would be so to say easily gone and offset by 2023. Most of i mean price measures of course now increasingly as time goes by will be in. Some of it. It might be spelled into 24. Thank you. If i come philip. Make a follow. From. Via from up. Please go ahead. Please the first one is on flight number 13. And the right hand side of it for your show the headwinds and the price recovery. I was just curious when you make kind of a percentage breakdown. How much. You know of the price. Green bob blue bar that you have in the first half already and how much have you box with it. For the second half and how is it on the headwinds is that more equally split between the two hops. Yep thanks for the questions then needless to say was expecting that clear i mean. I would say in reg. To the in inflationary effects like i said is an answer to philip just before. I do think that maybe it's. It's a 4460. 40% in the first half of the year 60% in the second half of the year as far as inflation. Effects of goal. So 4060 in regards to pricing and the cost measures it's rather a 370 let me put it this way. Which leads to the fact mathematically that in the first half of the year we still have on the on the overall bottom line profitability side is still a negative. The inflationary impact insult to say which we should be able to. Possibly overcompensate in the second half of the year which then overall which is this slide. That number 13 should be able to completely offset it with all meas. So take everything together for the full year it should be offset. Last question i had was just on the transition to irs. I was just wondering how much more you have to go there and. You know how much maybe more resources you have to put in place and then maybe something you have to still catch up from. The time before you joined. Because you know what one example for me was the the free cash flow right it was -7. And you pre-announced now it's minus 35. I think it still has something to do with that transition from the german gap. July verizon is there still lots of work to be done but you wish for more resources to do this or but possibly think about this. Yeah thanks thanks man for the. As as a first of all in eastern around eastern time we have completed the complete rollout of fs in the ap systems. I'm very grateful for that achievement to the whole team and it's as you know much more than just the finance guy so to say being involved there in the end so it's a great achievement that this company has done. Also did cost quite some money but we did it and then first of all is is now after that. East of the weekend everything perfect potentially not but we are on a very good way i think we have. The gained over the last 2 years significantly better grip and then. How to save a better governance over the systematics of ifos around the globe was established so i'm pretty confident and and pretty happy with the status achieved not everything perfect yet but we will also invest in future. We clearly know what we want to. In terms of capacity and knowledge and skill. Invest in the future in the accounting functions but also in in stakeholding. A functions around accounting fuel accounting. For example of some treasury when it comes to hatch stuff hedger counting and and things like that so. Pretty happy not everything perfect yet and we have for finance agenda towards 2025 with 13 important topics how we want to der. The finance organization to an excellent one. And the plan is clear. Hope that's fine for your sp. Yeah understood thank you frank and have a good summer all. Yeah you too you too all the best. Thank you there are no further. I'm. This time i will turn the conference back. You for additional or closing. Yeah thank you very much eileen yeah. Thank you very much for your time and we wish you a great weekend. In case you didn't have some holiday break enjoy it. And then having your back we are more than happy talking to you again and thank you. Today's call. Thank you for your. You may now.
