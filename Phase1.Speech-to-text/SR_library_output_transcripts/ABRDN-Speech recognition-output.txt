Good morning and welcome to the aberdeen first half results for 2022. I'm joined by stephanie bruce or cfo. Richard wilson ceo of the personal well factor. No but well see you of the advisor vector. And chris to meet you on randy bowman ce. Of investments factor. Freshly i will cover a performance as a group and show you how the strategy of diversification and investing your capital and growth areas. Is beginning to benefit the group results. Secondly stephanie will go through the detailed financial performance. And then i will look at the impact of the market environment. On the timing of the delivery of our strategy. Are capital stands on dividend returns. And how we see the near termitally before opening to questions. In the first half revenue was 8% lower. Adjusted i just did operating profits 28% lower. And custom ratio increased by 4%. All compared to the first half of last year. Netflix over all recorded a creditable performance in this market. With neck hurt floors at 1%. Of opening a un. At the half year i said it's under management including liquidity and l. We're 6% lower than the start of the year. The group results have been reduced principally by the market impact on revenues. Within the investments factor. With profits were 40% lower. Well the advisor and personal factors were up. 3% and 75% respectively. The lights are posted bolstered by one month's contribution from interactive investor. I'm pleased to report that ii is performing ahead of our expectations when we signed the deal last year. We deliberately strung to the group into three vectors. Two of which have grown. Even in the most challenging of markets. When i joined what is no aberdeen in late 2020 i said that we would pursue a strategy of refocus. An investments factor to it is a str. And growth potential. And that we would expand our reach in the higher grow. And higher margin uk savings and wealth market. Despite the challenging market context we are doing exactly that. Why are the worst thing market environment inevitably means that it will take longer to deliver our stated financial targets. We have the right strategy. And we have the team. The right capabilities on the capital resources. To execute it well. We have no successfully addressed the significant gap that we had in our business model. By acquiring ii. Which is transformed our position in the uk savings and wealth market. Our balance sheet remains strong. Even after significant returns to shareholders. And a significantly stronger. Then we believe should be necessary to support investment in our business. Unbeater stated dividend commitments. As we know have greater clarity on the capital needs of the business. We can tip we will continue to allocate capital to deliver shareholder returns. Returning capital in excess of business needs is further stick seals are realized. I will first focus my remarks on our global investments business. Where are ambitious program of change is underway and where the benefits. Google the crew from management actions are greatest. The procyclical nature of asset management means that it has been most impacted. By the fall in market. This illustrates precisely why. A strategy of diversification for aberdeen. Has been so important. I will cover the progress we're making an advisor and share further details of the strong performance in interactive investor. And the plans that we have for the future growth of the personal vector. Turning to the investments factor. This is the business with the greatest foundations and people and process. Whoever has been hampered. By having to deal with legacy issues and a lack of modernization. The rebuilding program is already underway. And we will show you the progress today. As well as outlining and detail i would approach to addressing an unacceptable. Cost income ratio. Financial results in the first half have been impacted by industry-wide negative returns from falls and market levels. Which have resulted in 11% lower revenue. And 40% lower operating profit. And an increase in cost income ratio to 86%. How's the business continues to build out from its legacy position and traditional core equity in multi-asset strategies. It is no surprise that we have seen the majority of the un declines. In those areas. Pleasingly it is a more recent strategic focus. The generate longer term revenue stream. I'm attractive revenue margins. Such as real ass. Another alternatives. I've delivered aum growth in the first half. Despite the challenging environment. We are progressing well with reshaping a equity franchise to focus on asia. Sustainability and schematic capabilities. Are multi asset capabilities provide the crucial foundations for the delivery. Of client-led sol. I'm confident that these areas. Over business will return to growth. Over the medium term. Even in current market conditions. Our flu position continues to stabilize. Without flaws of 3.3 billion. Excluding liquidity. Driven largely by public markets. Turning to floors geographically. As i said overall this performance represents encouraging stability and our position despite the environment. You can see that have been differences depending on region. Devon primarily by i said types and local market dynamics. Institutional and wholesale light flows were limited to. 1% of assets. In the uk are home market we've seen important programs. With netflow is improving. By 33%. That has been continuing benefit delivered from diversification. Including commodity et. In the us. Indonesia we've seen broadly flat net flows in a market experiencing net outflows. I'd like to focus in and one of our bolt on acquisitions. For the investments business try tax. We purchased 60% of try tax in late 2020 as part of a repositioning of real assets. This gave us exposure to the warehouse and logistics distribution sector. Since it's acquisition aum has grown by 33%. Titax works closely with a established aberdeen real assets team. And as an illustration of how we're working together has contributed to the. Toledo capital raising for the british volt power and electrification project. The additional tritax to the vector has added capability. Specifically in the logistics ecosystem and green energy area. And the collaborative approach to delivering growth scale and client access. I don't specific attention to this acquisition. Fix it demonstrates commitment to our strategy. The role of bolton acquisitions. Demonstrates how we can grow. Even in tough markets. Of course the prime driver of floor is in the long term. Is investment performance. Which is best viewed relatively. Over one year. Our performance shows 53% of a.m. ahead of benchmark. 3 years 63%. And five year 61%. We've seen the impact of market conditions result in mixed performance across asset classes. Performance in real ass. Alternat. I'm fixed income is highly competitive over the short and longer term. A performance and equities in multi asset remains a critical focus. And both were impacted in the period by the market derating of growth. Annotation into value. We are reshaping these franchises to be considerably more focused. I overarching goal is to achieve more consistent investment performance. And we are investing in our people. Processes and technology to make that happen. We outlined how the investment factor strategy fitted into the group strategy in march last year. And while the environment has changed dramatically across all economic indicators. We remain fully committed to delivery. Indeed we will step up the pace of change. In this market dislocation. We're changing the shape of an investments business. And reposition yourself in higher growth asset classes. That play to existing aberdeen strength. And global tr. Through this repositioning we are focusing and investing in growth areas. Exiting subscale businesses. I'm driving down cost. This one position is optimally when brother globally economic recovery resumes. We see highly attractive investment opportunities. Aligned to the global. And we have the investment expertise. That is necessary to capitalize on them. And to be clear you will progress it you will see us progressively move away from a broadwater front offering as we focus the business. When it is where we have competitive stren. On scale. There are three things that we are doing in the investments vector. I've already talked about the focus and improving investment performance. Secondly. We're working to drive improved flows. And certainly we're reducing cost. We are continuing to accelerate fund development. And launches in areas of growth. Increasingly through time we will shape new retail offerings. Guided by the data that flows from our market leading advisor and personal vectors. But right now we're executing our programs to drive transformation. And reduce the cost base of the investment vector itself. And your product and solutions are designed to capitalize. On the global growth. Let me highlight recent launches. Asia sustainable. China net next generation. Follow on funds and commercial real estate debt. And code infrastructure. And easy to access package solutions. Such as my folio sustainable. And global risk mitigation. We are confident that these new product init. Combined with actions to improve invest. Performance in our existing capabilities. Will contribute to grow. As market conditions improve. We are well into an ambitious fundraationalization program. That will result in the closure or merger of about 110 fun. We're simplifying your organization resulting in lower head count. And fewer management layers. Over the coming months we will complete the transition to a single global middle office for public markets. Unlocking cost benefits. Trump strategic. Of part. As a result of these actions we are committed to delivering gross cost savings. Of 150 million pounds. By 2024. I know for the same period. We will rein. 75 million. In the business. Turning to advisor. We have the uk's largest advisor platform by assets under administration. With an impressive reach of more than 50%. Of uk advice businesses partnering with us. The strength of our existing offering and the quality of service is already highly regarded. With a 96% customer satisfaction score. We're building on that strength investing. To further enhance our technology capability. I'm the advisor experience. We were ready i did new portals and new ways of engaging with us. I didn't and then the second half. We will launch your nick significant upgrade. Overhauling the look and feel of the platform. Making it much more intuitive. Stream. And focusing on helping. The advisory businesses that we serve. By shooting that when firms partner with aberdeen they can deliver more for their business success. We didn't turn increase advocacy growth and retention. For aberdeen. I continued investment and advised experience will further enhance her leadership position. In a market that is estimated to grow you. By 19% kiger through 2025. 2025. In this half year the advisor vector has performed strongly. With girls and both the base revenue up by 6% to 92 million. An adjusted operating profit up by 3%. 238 million. Display the tightening consumer environment. The acquisition of aye completed at the end of may has transformed our position in the vibrant uk wealth market. And delivers a significant acceleration of growth revenue and diversification for the group. The transition of ii into aberdeen has been smooth. And richard's senior leadership team ensures continuity in management. And delivery of the next phase of growth. In terms of financial results in the first half. Aye aye has performed ahead of her business case expectations. In terms of revenue and profitability. Of which one month is recorded in the first half. Despite the less act of savings market ii has grown its customer base. To 408,000 adding. 19,000 customers and a half. And has been tend it's industry leading assets for customer of 128,000. This is driven a 17% increase in revenue. And 47% increase in adjusted operating profit. On a field year 2021 run rate basis. Well the cost income ratio improved. By 9% each points to 56%. Highlighting eyes operating scale. As we said that acquisition we believe aberdeen is the best home for ai as it brings stability and certainty for the business. And we have a clear roadmap to add significant scale going forward. Girls and i i is underpinned by three drivers. Strength of the platform. Compelling pricing. Unscale of the customer base. Aye aye has a fully scalable operating platform supported by cutting-edge data that drives personalized customer content and experience. This is what will enable significant future margin expans. I ice transparent flat fee subscription model is favored by customers and a recent and over recent month. It is launched to see these of offerings to further grow they existing customer base. Including bundling. Fixed the pension provision. Find advice. As part of a growth strategy plan we are folding the aberdeen established personal business. Well services digital advice on the financial planning team. Under richard who will lead this a ceo of the entire personal wealth vector. This will enable us to offer an end-to-end customer proposition from simple online transactions. Two more complex financial advice. We are developing further synergies to fully serve this integrated customer group. Taken together growth and advisor and personal vectors will significantly increase our exposure to the fast growing. Uk wealth market. And will transform the shape and the source of group revenue in line with our stated strategic ambition. Richard is with us today for any. I'll hand over now to stephanie. Good morning. And thank you steven. As steven has highlighted our results in this half of principally been impacted. By market levels in 2022. Which is reduced our fee-based revenue. At a group level revenue is 8% lower. Children at 11% reduction from the investments factor. With advisor and personal partly mitigating this impact. Through revenue growth in both factors. Adjusted operating profit. Is 45 million lower than prior year. Due to 50 million. Contribution from the investment sector. Which has been significantly impacted. By the market performance and equities in this half year. Together with the impact of net outflows and equities in the last 12 months. This has resulted in an increase in the cost income ratio in the investments factor to 86%. Well this has been disappointing. The benefits of the actions taken to diversify the business or already evident as our vectors operating in the uk well sector are both delivering resilient revenue growth and profit contributions. Even in these volatile markets with decreasing consumer confidence. As a proportion of the group results profits from our uk platform and wealth management businesses have increased from 26%. To almost 40%. And of course we only have one month of iii results included at the half year. Now if we had owned ii for the whole of the first half. Advisor and personal would have accounted for over 50% of proof former group adjusted operating profits in the period. Given the acquisition of aye this higher contribution of adjusted operating profits from the advisor and personal vectors is a trend we now expect to continue. The advisor team have driven increased revenue of 6%. Due to hire average aua and stable yields over the period. Adjusted operating profit of 38 million was 3% higher. The cost income ratio of 59% is a small increase on prior year and reflects the current overlap of specific outsource service as we continue to transform this business. The consolidated results for the personal factor include just one month's contribution from interactive investor. But giving it scale it's impact has been to increase the vectors revenue by 41% and adjusted operating profit by 75%, cost income ratio of 56% will have an immediate uplift to the efficiency of the personal vector overall. To demonstrate the eye impact for the group. Just the one month profit contribution is 6% accretive to the group's eps for the half year. Now in the management report. Provided today we have provided the key financial and operating metrics for ii for the full year 2021 and half year 2022. And these evidence the strong growth trajectory of the business and the resilience of its subscription-based model. Our dividend policy is unchanged and the interim dividend is 7.3 pence. Benefits from our actions to diversify the business are also evident in a change of mix in our assets under management. Auma at the half year. Are 6% lower than at the year end. With market movements contributing. 52 billion or 10% of opening a un. The primary negative headwind and institutional wholesale was within equities. This movement was largely offset by the value of iizue of 55 billion at acquisition. I was in overall group net outflows of 36 billion circa 90% reflects lloyd's exits and liquidity net outflows. The lloyd's exits are now complete with the final transfer of 24 billion executed in this half year period. Liquidity net outflows in the half year of almost 8 billion arose as corporates drew down cash built up during covid. Now you will recognize that these are relatively low margin products. So the revenue impact is less significant. We have been successful in retaining around 7.5 billion of lloyds assets in a new courts mandate which will be run in our institutional wholesale team. Excluding these lloyds and liquidity flows net outflows were circa 4 billion. Which at 1% of aum is similar to prior year levels and reasonably encouraging given the challenging markets. Advisor and personal continue to attract positive new business at 1.7 billion. Opiates at a lower level than the prior year reflecting less consumer activity. Personal fluids have also benefited from one month's contribution of flows for my eye. Within institutional wholesale our auma highlight increasingly different patterns of investment. Between the traditional asset classes of equities and fixed income. Compared to the real asset an alternative franchises. Are increased focus on these latter asset classes has benefited performance in this half year. Since the start of the year. About 2/3 of the book which is in traditional areas of equities fixed income and multi asset so decline in overall aum. Principally due to market impacts. And realize it and other alternatives which represented around 1/3 of our book at the start of the year. We have increased levels of aum even in these challenging times. As a result the aum and these asset classes have no grown during this half year to represent 43% of the total book. I was at june and generated 2% growth in revenue. Our focus group strategy in the investments factory is underpinned by concentration on our areas of competitive strength. Within institutional wholesale real assets has grown to the second largest asset class. Driven by the investments in tritax. Which compliments are established aberdeen capability. Decline in markets based fee revenue and performance fees accounted for the majority of the reduction in revenue in this half year. There was a small net 4 million negative impact on revenue from disposals and acquisitions versus the comparative period. The biggest of which was armenian. It is important to note that net outflows and yields each had less than 1% impact on revenue. With an investments the main reduction revenue was concentrated with inequities. Which remains the largest source of ebay's revenue in the investment factor at 42%. The word reductions in revenue across most other asset classes other than alternatives and real assets which saw a 7 million increase largely due to try tax. I'm looking forward into the second half. We have revenue tailwinds from a full 6 months contribution from ii and certain specific fee uplifts of circa 9 million pounds. In addition our performance fees are skewed to the second half. And we expect continued positive flows and advisor and personal wealth. Market levels have shown some signs of improvement in july. And if this trend continues provides a further tailwind. With a greater contribution from my eye are sensitivity to market-based fee revenue will be lower. With neto fluids at 1% of opening auma. Flux activity has been relatively stable in these challenging markets. Insurance flows continue to be lumpy and we had minimal benefit in this first half of 2022 from levels of bulk purchase and utility activity by our insurance clients. In addition that continued de-risking is impacting asset allocations for insurance to lower margin exposures. We expect these market conditions to drive continued volatility in the pattern of both flows and mix of business in these mandates. Advisor fluids have been resilient. Stephen highlighted there are a number of new products and service improvements coming in 2022 and 223 which are aimed at growing assets on our platforms. Personal flows 3 billion include the flows for my eye of one month that we are consolidating. Eyes netflix for the full 6 months to 30th of june we're 2.2 billion. Getting 2% market share in the period. Now as i explained that the full year. We are reshaping the cost base by reducing the core structural cost required to operate our investment activities. Improving efficiency. And creating the capacity to invest in our chosen growth areas. We've continued with cost actions in the first half of 2022. Which of course have been undertaken in a changed environment for both inflation and interest rates. Overall the adjusted operating costs a half year at 2% lower than the prior comparative. The first half cost benefit. Went about 20 million from the disposals made in 2021. Namely permian the nordics real estate business and the heart and buena court businesses in the us. This broadly offsets the increase cost from try tax minimize and ii. Across the three vectors excluding ii we have reduced the head. My circuit 10%. From around 5,500 at june 21. To 5,000 at june 2. Even with the additional cost from acquisitions notably try tax and ii for full year 2022 we have a clear pathway in current markets to lower overall operating costs. We aim to deliver a similar percentage level of cost reduction for full year 2022 to that we have achieved in h1. This will be driven by cost management within the investments factor. A further reduction of head count by about circa 10%. And continued cost control across the group. If we are to achieve our cost income ratio target we need to deliver growth of revenue in the investment sector. As well as reducing the cost. Looking forward three factors in the investments vector are now impacting the timing of the achievement of our objective of high single digit revenue cargo by the end of 2023. The current significant uncertainty in global markets. The associated impact on fl. And the shift in client asset allocations to lower risk and lower margin products. This adds priority to our continued focus on delivering the program of cost savings through the rationalization. Simplification and streamlining of activities in the vector which we have previously reported in march. No on this slide each of the five areas of activity are designed to realize substantial sav. And are already well underway. A few areas that i'll highlight. We have now reviewed circa 550 fun. And concluded that 20% with an aum of about 7 billion are subscale inefficient or not are no longer aligned with our core strengths. These will be merged or closed. Resulting in simplified fund ranges across the uk and luxembourg door massage funds. I'm moving duplication and simplifying our product offering and freeing up resources. This program of work will continue through the second half of. 22 and into the first half of 23. Resulting in a product shelf aligned to our key strands and to client demands. Although there will be a revenue impact from actions which target both fund rationalization and dispose of known correctivities that are inefficient or subscale. Once completed the overall cost income ratio of the group will improve as a result of these initiatives. As our clients asset allocation profiles are changing. We continue to review the cost of servicing these complex mandates across the equity and multi asset businesses. We are confident that we can unlock savings in technology and information servicing course. As we change how we service such mandates. We will continue to exit non-core businesses which are no longer aligned to the overall strategy and where we do not have scale or a strong growth franchise. Recent examples are hard and bone accord and the nordics real estate businesses. We do not expect any further such disposals to impact the revenue or cost based before 2023. We are simplifying our investments operating model to realize efficiencies. By creating a single middle office operating model we increase capacity and delivery of client service. Well i reshaping of the factor has recently unified the uk and european equities teams in order to streamline processes. The full suite of actions in train is targeted to deliver net savings of 75 million with gross savings of circa 150 million before reinvestment of 75 million to support growth. The majority of the initiatives will impact 2023 with benefits fully realized in 2024. Additional restructuring costs associated with these actions are expected to be broadly funded by proceeds from the disposal of our non-core assets. We continue to have a strong balance sheet even after the acquisition of ii and an uncovered dividend due to the capital actions we have taken. Movements in capital in the first half were dominated by the consideration for ii which was settled in cash from our group liquid resources. We benefited from the sale in january of part of our phoenix steak which raise 0.3 billion. At june available capital is 2.3 billion comprising a regulatory capital surplus of 0.6 billion and 1.7 billion of additional but unrecognized capital from our value of listed stakes. We will continue to restructure and invest in the business to support organic grow. Across our diversified business model in order to achieve our ambitions for sustained revenue growth. And a 70% cost income ratio. We use an internal management buffer for the regulatory surplus simply as a management tool. To support a disciplined approach to capital management with the objective of supporting both our growth ambitions and continued shareholder returns. We are conscious of disappointment in our share price and remain focused on growth of return for shareholders. We announced our intention to return 300 million to shareholders and commenced an early july 150 million share buyback program which we estimate will take h2 to complete. As previously stated we will continue to monetize the indian stakes as a key element of our disciplined approach to capital management. As a result and as we deliver our priorities and investments and generate performance from all three vectors. Adjusted capital generation will more closely track profits. Given the scale of our resources we can support investment in our businesses as well as our state of dividend policy. Where we generate capital beyond the needs of our business we will continue to make capital returns to shareholders. Such returns will reduce the overall cost of servicing future dividends as the share count is reduced. I'm back. The dramatic shift in the global economy is impacted the industry. Under a financial results. Despite these headwinds by concentrating on what we can control. We have continued to deliver our strategy of building a much more durable business. Through the three vector model. Based around diversification of revenue sources. The current market turbulence strongly reinforces that this is the right strategy. The two vectors operating in the uk wealth market. Have both delivered resilient performance under on track. To increase her diversification into higher growth. Higher margin businesses. Performance and investments vector was like all of the sector hit by market turbulence. Combined with those being a period of restruct. We are doubling down and focusing the business on the strengths that lean into the micro global growth trends. Cutting cost. I'm driving effic. The current economic and market conditions mean that our ambition for group revenue growth and cost income improvement will take longer to deliver. Depending of course on the speed of the market recovery. We are continuing to execute in our client-led growth strategy. First by improving the performance of each vent. And then by extracting value across all three. We are confident our approach will diversify earnings. Improve efficiency. Delivered or revenue and customizations and insure optimal use of capital. Know that the shape of the group is largely settled. You can expect inorganic actions on a more modest level. These will likely include both further advancement. I'm selective reinvestment. Will we see capabilities that we need and compelling value. We are announcing a half year dividend today of 7.3 pence. As i said earlier are disciplined approach to allocating capital. Is focusing on delivering shareholder returns. And we will continue to return capital in excessive business needs. It's for the steak seals i realized. While the global economic outlook remains very uncertain. We are focusing on what we can control. Namely the continued execution of our strategy. And that will provide diversification of revenue streams. And put the grip on a sustainable. Traject. That concludes our presentation will not take a short. Break and resume for your. Welcome back i'd like to ask the operator to open up for. Of course. For the first question is coming from nicholas hermann from citig. Please go ahead. Yes good morning thank you taking my questions. A lot to dig into but i'll try to limit myself. I'm just one question one clarification if that's okay. So did the classification is could you please clarify the. Expected revenue nutrition. From the. Consolidation and rationalization. And then my question will cost. 514 million crossword clue business in about 40 million cost. Decline coming from the cool business. Just to confirm. I thought he's coming from you. Initiative not from. Flexing or delaying investment spend with a media catch up later on. And i guess it's part of that then when do you think you can now achieve your. Post information target of about 70% thinking. 2024 or 2025. No thank you. So so let me let me open that up and then i'll i'll ask stephanie to talk a little bit more about the detail and the cost reduction. So. The fundraction that we're doing. Is is very very obvious 110 funds. That comprise 7 billion of assets. So this is a $508 billion. Business you've got. One and a half percent of funds. That. 110. Fund management activities. Arrange. So it's it's the right thing to do now of course it takes time to do it but it's it's really. I'm compelling logic to rationalize that tail. Such that our energy or focus or research and a disciplines applied to the go forward growth business. So so that's the so when you think about the eums and the scale of the total business you can see that it has a very small imp. I on revenues. And stephanie will talk a little bit about detail the cost reduction but let me address. Your question on the 70%. Custom racial target. So we focused in this market environment there's market dislocation underway st patrick's entire asset management sector. We're using that environment to accelerate the actions that we need to take that we can control. We're not sitting here waiting for the market to recover we are addressing the things we. Control. And that's what you would expect us to do. Hey the cost income ratio is a function of revenue growth and cost. So because revenue is uncertain. In this market environment i'm specifically sharing detail on the things we control which is cost. Where will the revenue environment be where will the market environment be but what will market levels be over the piece it's we don't know this is a point in maximum mark on certainty so it would be fool. To give you the the cost income ratio a timeline for that. The ambition to achieve it. Is unchang. The resolve to take the actions against. The cost base is is strong. And we're well into the process. But i'm not going to speculate on where the market revenue is going to be at this point. Stephanie. And nicholas thank you and i and i think sorry my i think i caught most of that question but in terms of the 2022 course and being able to give you the guidance that overall we see a total reduction in 2022 full year it's not about delaying investment at all words being a very considered series of actions that we already have well underway and that will play out into 2022 and we can make that statement around a total overall. Cost reduction in 2022 even taking account of the additional cost coming through from ii. I'm aware of those coming from principally from the impacts of the actions that we've had through in terms of headcount but all in terms of very close management of our supplier contracts. And those are are having benefits as we come through in 2022. The program of course that we've talked about very specifically within the investment factories also well underway at the majority of those actions will be complete by the end of 2023 and we will see the many of the benefits in 2023. But equally we will see the full relies benefits in 2024 and that program as i say is well underway already. Thank you n. And we have the next question. From arnold key. From exchange please go ahead. If i could just ask. Accountification in terms of the quantum of net savings achieved that there will be achieving 2022 out of the 75 million announced them today. My my question is on nothing just margins at i. Continue can i ask you what the net interest margin are you currently unemployed monies. And can you get up give us a bit of a sensitivity to the short-term base rating in the uk. And do you see a risk of the fca stepping in at some point and maybe imposing something for the pastoralism of high and straight stuff for your clients cuz. I'm generating in the retail brokerage brokerages we've seen that. I'm a lot of the upside coming straight to is being hit by the platform i'm just wondering if it's a risk of the fca stepping in at some point and asking me asking you to party specifically for supplies. Thank you. Hi so thank you for your question actually i'll hand over to to richard in a moment to to address that. The first thing that i would say and i think this is very important. In terms of that's interest margin first of all if you look at the uk bank sector the entire bank sector has so far. Passed on only 15% of the increase in their interest mar. So that is obviously. Much much bigger. All right for the market overall than any of the direct investing platform. No i replied for him i. Offers the best value. All right for the direct investor in the uk. And we live we analyzed that value across the entire. Total cost to a client so the subscription model. They we recently reduced the cost associated with. Subsequent trades. And we analyze that relative to appears and we are committed to ensuring the eye remains. The best value platform. The best way to access. That investing in the uk. We actually also just did announce a pass through to the ii clients as a consequence of rates moving up. Lay behind over. Richard to eliminate that a little bit further. Thank you steven. Cleaning up with also seeing here is this is. The end of it. Very long period of crazy interest rates. And i i start. Interest for the first time ever. Then in july as. Mentioned. Currently and in terms of. Answer the business life cycle or assumption. Subject to the vagaries. Market forces is. That interest margin. Hover around. 100 basis points. That subject to all sort. I'm uncontrollables. But not least of which is the bank of england. The shape of the yield cur. The precious etc. But what we should be seeing. Compared to what's been the case for the last 15 years where we've had artificially super compressed rates. Is some reversion to. A more normal level. Some interest mar. Recruiting. The business. Supposed to. Respect the question around regulatory action and. Just to build on stevens point. Today the clearing banks i believe it's. A low interest. It would be. An extraordinary step for the regulated price regulate and in this space and it's. Move that foot. A long way. Where. Time today. And given the the fact that platforms including ourselves. Listening to. Market forces and we are. I'm. Interest on accounts. It would be a very surprising. Something is being. Reconcile and raise occasion of the last 15 years and is usually the dies. The first breath i don't. He has. I'm sorry to the original. I'm. I'll spread expectations. Points. Kiss represents a reversion to. Of interest. The business cycle. Thank you nicholas. And we have the next question from haleytown from credit. Please go ahead. Morning steven morning stephanie thank you very much for taking my question. Costco i lost quick questions and i'll be sure to hopefully. On. Festival. The 150 million pounds of gross cost savings in investments that's a big number it's 15%. Of your call space in that vector in 2021. Does that mean that the unlike any further sources of savings after that so we should look at revenue growth as the driver beyond those. And could you clarify for me. Just exactly what the scale is that you expect to spend in terms of additional restructuring costs associated with that. So that we can better understand how much of the proceed. I'm doing cool asset disposals that might consume. I'm in the future. And then and just won't put in a classification by my own interactive i noticed that. New customer growth seems to have been 4,000 in each one's it's 404,000 in december and 48,. Now in the jun. Yet you say you added $19,000 new customers so just like understand something one off about. Some redemptions there per. Yeah thank you what i'm going to do is we'll take the eye question first because. I did you do need to understand that the net new number i gave you is correct. All right you didn't need to understand the post acquisition activity that's going on in ii richard i'll talk to that. And then i'll hand over to chris and crystal talk about. That you're right the gross level of saves 150 million is material because we are materially reshaping the business. But we did state that it's a net save. Of 75 million because we have specific investment. Associated with the change program as well richard would you like to comment on the. The numbers. Sure so on that the question of the net new customers we have two things going on. On the one hand we have our organic engine. I'm which is. That currently producing. Matt andalized 5% growth so. That's around. And your customers on account runway basis completely that's easily skewed so the q1. Tends to be high. But to your comment on the on the absolute numbers we also have. The daily facts of a number of previous acquisitions. Deliver. The share center and. In june 21. Eqi business liquidity. And those that tell books have some runoff which would skew those two numbers. Thank you thanks richard. So chris would you like to talk about the. What would i actually doing what you actually doing in the business. To drive these. The simplific. In the rationalization of the. 150 million of gross savings and i'll cost income ratio at the moment certainly on the cost side of that equation. As long as they function of the inherent complexity that exists in the organization as a feature of a business that has grown in organically over in the in the past. We threw our program of simplification we are eliminating a lot of that complexity that the sort of complexity premium that exists in the cost base the fund rationalization is a material part of that the service the disposal of non-core assets. And to your point around the restructuring cost within the capital that we're going to generate from non-core acid should should broadly offset any requirement for significant restructuring cost so we wouldn't anticipate you needing to model for material step up and restarting costs over and above. I'm the capital that we're going to generate from from simplification. I'm sorry we are programs really really quite clear now we we know exactly where traffic classes we we are looking to move forward with an invest in we know which strategies inside of our desks we don't believe we're aligned to the trends that steven outlined earlier on. And them and the program of shutting down 110 funds or merging 110 funds into areas to create more scale in the business is is well on the way and making really good really good progress so it is a it is a large number of essentially the overall cost based but it's available to us as a result of the inherent complexity. Has existed in the business historically. We're going to clear plan to reduce that complexity and therefore take that out. But it's really important to think about the extra 75 million of investment in the business because. The organization really is demonstrating. The ability to raise assets in in our focus areas and good revenue yields. Yeah some examples of the largest revenue generating fund in the business at the moment is that is try taxes big box fund which has a blended fee margin of over 50 basis point. We're in the market raising. Accord infrastructure fund that. Attract 7280 basis points depending on the size of the commitment. And so we are we already optimistic about our ability to raise assets in high margin. Strategies that over time as we get our flows into the right place will will create a growth business that attractive margins and so. It's important that we invest to make sure that we can deliver on that the growth potential that the organization has. Terrific. Can i can i clarify the capital from non-co. That will cover the. Are you referring there. Investment. Take sales or actually sales. On cross. We were in reference to disposals within the investment factor. Yeah it's not not related to the steak sahel. Thank you. We have the next question coming from tell mills from jeff. Please go ahead. Hey good morning i. I saw that the the n i i from interactive investors with 17 million in the first half. I appreciate your answer to honest question but can you just give us maybe what you're expecting the run rate. Contribution from that to be. Based on the rate rises that we've already seen come through that that would be helpful thanks very much. Yeah thank you thank you very much tom let me switch over. To richard for that. Hi thanks tom you got a wonderful answer to. The previous question. I'm not sure i can. Back. And there was a few variables out there and rates are and steven said earlier we have. A dislocation period and a great deal of volatility. I'm so i'm going to stick. I think i'm getting close to the end of the call operator do you have another question. Yes we do. Should i move on to the next one. All right it is coming from steven hayward from hsbc despac. Hi steven. Hi good morning sorry about the background noise and two questions from me the 56% combined. Income ratio is this sustainable can it get even better. Thanks for. And then secondly i think stephanie mentioned the capital resources cover the dividend cost but can you tell us when will yearly adjusted kevin capital generation. Comma your dividend cost thank you. Okay so we'll take that in two parts. First of all the 56% yes it can get better. Hi this is her this is a scalable business we one of the things that attracted us to it was the fact that the tech was built out. Did it says a terrific data model that uses the data to be able to inform the way it develops this product. It's. And that we fully expect to be able to improve that from this point going forward. Stephanie would you like to talk a little bit about adjusted capital generation yes i think increasingly as i as i referenced steven in my in my script the we see just the way that we're being very disciplined approach to capital that increasingly adjusted capital generation will very much track adjusted operating profit. And therefore you should think of that in exactly the same way in increasingly in terms of its cover for dividend. Hey stephen well folks we've reached the end of the call thank you very much for your your interest in our turnaround story and. The progress that we've made and deploying capital into successful businesses. We're confident that we are. Very focused on the things that we can control and highly uncertain world. I think that's what you really want us. So thank you very much.
