You guys have built a phenomenal business the last 11 years i'm really proud to be parked for the palo alto network family. I hope you will join me in this journey to make followers of the cyber security leader of the world data is going to be important in the future. Integration is going to be important in the future. And the cloud is going to be important. The whole company is geared towards making amazing products. Product that sold the problems for customers. And also. Towards a mission of preventing successful cyber. That's important that's what we stand for that's our emails. We do good stuff you make it work and make it happen people trust. People are at the center of our strategy. If they have the best people in the world we can make great things happen. Go follow the network. Thank you great good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. As you can see from the video we were excited to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our ipo in early july. Our employees are engaged and excited as you continue confidently on our mission to be the cyber security partner of choice. Want me to q4 i'm pleased to report. If you're getting solve a strong results. Starting a top line results that were well ahead of the guid. We initially outlined for the fiscal year 22. We deliver this girl while balancing our profitability commitments. We also made significant investments to continue to transform our company and take advantage of the large and rapidly growing market opportunities. On the top line. Billings grow to 44% was the highest we've reported in 4 years. He also grew up here ahead of our avenue growth rate. I keep focus of our team has been rapidly positioning us as a constant cybersecurity innovator. And when we measure our progress. Is how are ngs ar develops. The delighted to report this metric grew 60% reaching 1.9 billion exiting the year. We expecting it to reach 2.6 billion in a fight 23. If this was an independent start. It would be amongst the fastest growing cyber security businesses to achieve scale. Within our core network security business. Firewall as a platform billings group 26. When you started reporting this metric the intent was always to show that we continue to take shit. There in the network security market. The same time transform the business to a software business. Do they close to 50% of that comes from software form factors. Opening income group 52% in q4 and are operating module for the air finish to the high end of the guidance range. Adjusted free cash flow margin come in above the higher the range you provided. Youtube the major internal goal we've had on the profitability front. Delivering gap profitability this. Looking forward or guiding to fully air gap profitability in fiscal 2023. Is that many if you ask us about the macro environment. And how is it impacting our business in the markets we serve. The last year we arguably saw the most. Challenging supply chain conditions of technology industry has ever seen. We executed through this. Well during the air with modest impacts to our gross margin. We expect conditions will eventually ease. For planning we're assuming a material improvement won't be seen part of the end of fiscal year 23. I would rather supply challenges fade we expect this will start to have a favorable impact on our product go smart. There's a continuing debate on inflation it's nature and duration. We saw some labor another inflationary pressures in the second half. Physical air. We do not anticipate these pressures going away. In the next fiscal. And we have planned for it to persist to fiscal year 23. And hence it is including our plan is reflecting our guidance. Respect the macaron back in demand. Just come out of q4 with exceptional 44% building. An enterprise sales is most of you know the rescue for magic. We did however see some marginal changes the macro environment q4. Lost early it is important to see how the overall macroeconomic conditions develop over the next. You saw more longer duration deals as customers increasingly have the. Confidence to make large long-term commitments. This is important to the transformation objectives we set out for power to network. Confirms and validates our view that customers will consolidate if you give them constant best to be products and ensure that they're integrated to deliver better security outcomes. Second. We saw some isolated instances of customers extending the life of hardware. Potentially driven by macro forces. Expect out of the margin. This could continue until 5:23. It is counterbalanced by some customers refreshing their state. And i'll continue to share games. In the hardware form factor. Third in transformational projects the vast majority of our customers continue on their investments here despite the expect. Go to my current. Security spending is tied into our customers desires to move the cloud. Drive more direct relationship with their customers modernize their it infrastructure as well as driver efficiencies while adapting to new way of working. Those efforts continue. Couple with the height and awareness and need to do something on cyber security. We expect secular tailwinds to persistence our security and we are best position to deliver against our customer need. Other trade i would like to highlight. Is the return to palo alto networks by employees. Who had left for seemingly greener pastures. Or 6 months period as part of our welcome home program is engaged as many former employees to date dozens of top performers have been rehired with many more in the funnel. Over 70%. Of people reached out to have expressed a desire to come back to. And a significant number already have. 50% attorney from startups the next largest percentage coming from beer compan. We're happy to welcome these employees back to college. As he embark a new fiscalier. My 5th at fallout network ceo. Is worth reflecting where we came from. I'll transformation strategy has not been easy. But we are unwavering our resolve to build the most comprehensive and relevant offerings for our customers. Taking away their complexity and delivering a better security outcome. You see. To being the largest cyber security company backed by constant innovation and excellent execution. Becoming our customer service security partner choice while delivering delivering increasing value to our shareholders. Just 4 years ago we were a different company. We reinvented the firewall market and capture the market share leadership position. Never glimmers of our next generation security strategy but it made up just 8% of our billings. Our softest story network and security was early. Some tractional firewalls and a fledgling precursor the sassy called global product cloud services. We made our first acquisition in cloud native security and had early point products that would become part of cortex. Let me step back and took stock in the industry we had a key hypothesis which we then test. Who to ourselves and have reproduced across the business today. There's not previously been a cyber security company with the leadership position in multiple categories. Nor the customers believe that a cyber security platform. Could anchor the architect. You set out on this ambition journey as you said i prisma cloud in cort. As well as innovative significantly on network security capabilities. Fast forward to today our transformation has taken as far. You're recognize leader in the 11th cyber security categories across all three platforms. Next generation security contributed more than 38% of our billings. Helping to. Radar. Network security we not have the most comprehensive solution across three form factors. The share a common architecture. And also offer suite of market leading security subscriptions. We have. Assembled and integrated capabilities in nine modules that make up prisma cloud. So now the leader in cloud native security. Lastly we have three anchor products in cort. With with our new exile product showing promise. In the revolutionary security operations is going to hold us in good stead. The proof that this transformation is working is in the moment. We're seeing our customers. The number of customers that spend over $1 million dollars annually with us continues to grow. Millionaire countdown excess of 1200. The number of global 2000 customers. Better purchase products in all three of our platform. Is now 50%. Well we've had many large customer wins recently i want to highlight a team in three transactions. The first is. Pathology company that purchase products in all three of our platform. In transaction over 75 million dollars in value. Second is the financial services company that standardized its network security in a platform. Including adding vms and deploying prisma cloud. Spending north of 40 million. Answered the professional services company that spent over 75 million dollars across traffic on cortex. One of the outcomes from our transformation. Past 4 years is a steady increase in our subscription and support. Primarily driven by the growth of our next generation security business. Subscription support i exceed 80% of our billings. This has resulted in greater productivity in our re. You seen going commitments from our customers represent a greater portion. Of our next year's revenue. As we enter fiscal year 23 that number is 59%. At the midpoint of our guidance. Increasing gravity visibility gives us further confidence in our ability invest in. My future. This number is over 70%. For the revenue we expect you one. All of this is occurred while our revenue growth has accelerated from f520 to f522. In part is the accelerated growth in the next generation security offer. Well we have also taken. Share in traditional network security appliance form fact. As reported by third parties. Despite the success. So far in our transformation we still see significant potential ahead of us. Estimate are large addressable market to be growing at a rate of 14%. 29% are fiscal year 22 revenue growth more than doubled this market growth. As we have transformed the business we have seen our revenue growth re-accelerate. Even with this significant growth over the last 4 years. You still only represent approximately 6%. Over. The last presented our analyst in. December 2020. 6% sure of the market low for the market leader as compared to other categories and technology. So we see there is ample room to grow. There are numerous trends that excite us around our ability to drive this road. And continue to share games. You soon see a day where there's we a trillion dollars in public cloud consum. The observation thus far in this early market is that company's allocated 2 to 5% of the cloud budget security creating a significant prisma cloud opportun. Don't you have been worldwide cyber security jobs that are unfulfilled. Reviews that more training hiring alone will not effectively inefficiently counter the growing use of automation employed and attacks and the volume of al. That is overwhelming the security operation. You believe and you better time in security. Is needed that heavily leverages ai and automation. You're targeting this opportunity without cortex product. Next time product specifically. Ashley hybrid work is here to stay. There are more than 1 billion dollars workers globally we believe they have a strong position and sassy with our coverage of users and branch offices today. Just cashing the service is lost or. You have a clear mission in front of us and each of our security platforms to harness the opportunity that we have outlined. As this is q4. I figured rather than having me outline all the accomplishments from our product team i would invite lee clar. Patiently listens and sits in our calls. To give you more detail update to help you understand. I will continue to build our success again fy2. Thank you the cash. Has nakash highlighted. Across cyber security one of the biggest challenges has always been the overwhelming number of point products. The customers must deploy. Integrate in operationalized to achieve the security they need. In most cases this is never fully achieved. Leading to expensive yet suboptimal security outcomes. We are bringing into approach. One that delivers market leading capabilities. Tightly integrated in three platforms. Fy22 has been a significant year for us in network security. Where we have furthered our position delivering a consistent security architecture across hardware software and sassy. When your completion of our gen 4 hardware rollout. Which can some models delivers close to 10x performance over gen 3. As a result we saw over 50% of ng. W hardware sales in q4 on gen 4. Also an fy22. We introduced the cloud ngfw across three of the major clouds. Enabling our customers to adopt best in class network security in a cloud native service. And christmas sassy had three major launches in fy22. Including the most recent ztna 2.0 launch. Firmly establishing our next-gen approach to zero trust. Across our hardware software and sassy form factors we are able to deliver a consistent set of core security capabilities. Is ml powered cloud services. An fy22 we saw the rapid adoption of advanced euro filter. And we now see nearly all euro filtering sales on this advanced mlb service. Advanced threat prevention which was introduced in fiscal q3. Is also now off to a strong start. And perhaps most importantly. Customers can manage all form factors and security subscriptions from a single management console. To deliver consistent user experience and tremendous operational leverage. Well we believe the full platformers where customers will end up. We want to ensure customers can start their adoption with any form factor. And receive a truly best in class solution. The number of 1 million lifetime value sassy customers that are also customers of our two other network security form factors. And an fy22. At 210. This is up 8 fold since fy19. We have seven customers that have purchased all three of her form factors with 100 million in lifetime value in network security. More broadly when we look at our network security customer base. Customers that have bought all three platforms from us spend 10x more. More than those who are customers. I've only one form factor. This showcases the true value of our network security platform. Thank you for we introduced ztna to idaho. Which redefines state of the art in zero trust network access to bring uncompromised security. And deliver zero trust with zero exceptions. We have seen significant momentum at our customer traction on sassy and fy22. On a number of fronts. Our overall active sassy customer base grew by 51% in q4. And our million dollar sassy deals. To accelerate this year. Of 83% with over. $1,000,000 deals in q4 loan. Well many of these large deals are coming from our install base as they see the value across reform factors. It is equally important that over 30%. Of our new sassy customers in q4. Renew to palo alto networks. This highlights the competitiveness of our sassy solution. Enables us to reach net new customers. Additionally once we land with the new sassy customer we are seeing customers look to standardize on our hardware and software appliances. In the cloud we see that most customers are still relatively early in their journey. They're migrating workloads to the cloud and building new applications. Growing their footprints. Consuming more sophisticated services and adopting multiple clouds. With this has come an expansion in the cloud security needs. Our approach with prisma cloud delivers a comprehensive platform with a growing set of. Abilities to stay ahead of our customers need. Increasingly. Cloud security needs to start at the moment developers write their first lines of code through to deploying and running this code in public cloud. The acquisition of bridge crew brought us infrastructure as code. A way of detecting and fixing security issues during development. I see became our 9th integrated module of prisma cloud at the end of january. And in the first 6 months of availability. We are. Already have over 200 customers making it our fastest growing new module. We designed an incredibly easy way for our customers to activate any of the nine modules. And have grown the number of customers that use more than three modules. 2/3. And those using four modules to nearly 20%. Descriptionless module adoption has help. Fuel are 55% growth in credits consumed on the platform. We're also closing in on 2000 customers for prison club. It's great to see all the third party recognition like the. The award as best cloud workload protection solution that we announced today. But we're not done yet. We see several opportunities for new modules and will continue to look at both organic development. And external technology to drive continued expansion. The christmas cloud platform. We are earlier in the cortex platform journey. Executing well across her three core product categories of xdr. Security orchestration and automation. And a tax surface management. We saw significant progress in fy22 as we drove sales of our key products. An increased traction combining offerings and larger cross cortex transactions. Our customer counts for past 4000. And we also signed 52 transactions greater than 1 million in q4. Combined with this customer success. We also continued the rapid innovation that we believe will be required to be a leader in security operations more holistically. When we envision the future of cyber security. I don't see a path to success that is not heavily driven by ai and automation. Attackers are too well funded and determined. Well customer networks clouds applications and users are too complex. To manually defend. The only way to deliver meaningful security outcomes is by collecting rich useful data. Normalizing all data sources to a single source of truth. And then applying ai models to detect attacks and automate responses in real time. We are now taking this to the next level. Earlier this year we announced x i. A fully integrated ai driven stock platform. And kicked off a program with a limited number of design partners to ensure we had strong product market fit. The results of this design partner program are incredibly encouraging. Proving our assumptions about the value of good quality data powering ai-based attack detection. In native automation simplifying and speeding response. And i'm happy to say. Our first paid customer was a seven-figure purchase. And most of the other design partners are likely to purchase in the coming months. We are on track to launch the product into a broader set of our customers in the first half of fiscal 23. We cannot have accomplished all we have in the last several years in advancing our lead and network security. Standing up our cloud native security platform. And progressing toward the autonomous sock. Without our investments and innovation. Over the last several years. Our r&d spending has grown in order to enable our ambition to lead with the three platforms. You see this in major product. Which. Reached nearly 50 in fy22. As we move into fy23. We are more committed than ever to leading and. Cyber security innovation. My team went through a rigorous process of prioritizing our most important investment areas across. Are three platforms. With the continued investment in r&d. I'm confident we're set up to deliver a great set of innovations in the coming year. With focus on the most important areas for our success. I'll pass it back to. Thanks lee. Before i wrap up and pass it to deepak i want to provide you with a high level over. Of how we are thinking about our financial targets and f523. I highlighted the strong drivers at play including technology sector forces as well as drivers within cyber security. Please just talk to you about all the innovation we have underway. They continue to have confidence in our team's execution the traction we're seeing across our platform. We expect to continue to deliver strong results. In line with the profile you have talked about. For the first for the last year since our analyst day. Or fiscal year 2023 i think this in. Those billings girls are 20 to 21%. And have any girls with increasing predictability that is in the mid 20s. After achieving operating margin to high end for guidance and fiscal year 22 we intended to deliver operating margin expansion of 50 basis points of the high end for guid. Adjusted free cash flow margins of over 100 basis points of the high. I forgotten while absorbing increased supply chain. An inflationary impact. The chief got profitability in q4 fiscal year 22 and we project this will continue for fiscaler 23. Lastly today we also announced the three for one stocks but. This was done to help ensure our shares are accessible to all employees and investors. The stocks but also demonstrates our belief in the future of the company and the momentum and confidence we have in our strateg. Call pass on to deepak to discuss our q4 results in more detail as well as our q1 and a fiscal year 23 guidance. I'm kenny. And good afternoon everyone. Today we again reported another strong quarter which culminates in a strong fiscal year palo alto networks. The q4 revenue of 1.55 billion through 27% and was at the high end of our guidance range. Product screw 20% in total services grew by 30%. My geography we saw strong growth across all theaters with emir at 33%. The america is growing 26%. And jay park growing 24%. Next generation security arr route 60%. To 1.89 billion with strength across the portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2022 we deliver total billings of 2.69 billion. I'm 44% which was above the high end of our guidance range. Total the third revenue in q4 was 6.99 billion and increase in 39%. Remaining performance obligation or rpo was 8.2 billion dollars. Increasing 40% with current rpo representing about half of our rpo. Similar to recent quarters. Nearly all of our hardware products now refreshed as we had mentioned. Over 50% of our q4 product orders. What books were generation 4. Customer reception has been positive with the majority of customers still in the early phases of their upgrade. A file is a platform billings through 26%. We also continue to see an increasing software mix within our f1 billings. Up two points to 48% in q4. Moving beyond the top line metrics i've already highlighted non-gap gross margin is 73.2% was down 210 basis points 0 over year as we continue to incur additional expense. The components and shipping. We expect this headwind to persist for march of the school year 23. Lost q4 we guided. A fiscal 22 operating margin of 18.5 to 19%. But please to have achieved the high end of our goal by delivering 90% operating margin for fiscal year 22 while absorbing higher than expected supply chain cost. Long out net income for the 4th quarter group 57%. 254 million. 02.39 cents. $2.39 put value to check. I'm on gap effective tax rate was 22%. Cabinet income was 3 million dollars or 0.03. Basic and diluted chair. Turning down to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Finish q4 with. Equivalence and investments of 4.69 billion. Estate sales outstanding was 98 days. Several days above where it would have landed without the impact. Of lake quotas shipment. A discounts continue to be in line with what we've seen over the last year. Chief of cash flow from operations was 524 million. We generated adjusted free cash flow of 485 million. Achieved 33.3% adjusted free capital margins for the year. Above the high end of our 32 to 33% guide. Episcopia 22. Drink before we repurchase approximately 755,000 shares on the open market. An average price of approximately 483 per share. Her total consideration of 365 million. Additionally i bought a directors authorized an additional $915 million for share repurchase. Refreshing our authorization for future share repurchas. Back to a billion dollars. Expiring december 31. 2023. On the m&a front we close one very small acquisition in q4. Would you stop based compensation as a percent of revenue by approximately 3%. Year over here and quarter to quarter. Spc will remain a focus area in fiscal 23 as we balance the use of sbcs to attract and retain. Top cyber security talent with scale leverage we expect in this area. Lastly moving to guidance and modeling point. It is worth noting that in fiscal 22 we have flexibility built into our plans. That allowed us to execute through some real-time developments during the year. Such a supply chain and labor inflation. We've used the same approach in building off fiscal year 23 plans incorporating a degree of flexibility of outcomes. It's also worth noting that we saw very strong q4 business activity. In some cases this is from customers taking advantage of ordering hardware. Especially subscriptions ahead of a price increase that. Effect on august 1st. We also saw some customers make large commitments in the fourth quarter that might have otherwise happened in this year 23. If you think about next year note that in the second half of fiscal 22 we have very strong bill. With some benefit from an increase in invoicing of multi-ear contracts for a few. And she full without this impact of buildings would have been in the mid to high 30s. Turning to our guidance for the fiscal quarter of 2023. We expect billings to be in the range of 1.68 to 1.70 billion dollars and increase of 22 to 23%. We expect revenue to be in the range of 1.535 to 1.555 billion. An increase of 23 to 25%. We expect longer pps to be in the range of 2.03 to 2.06. The fiscal year 23. We expect billings to be in the range of 8.95 to 9.05 billion dollars and increase of 20 to 21%. We expect ngs error to be in the range of 2.60 to 2.65 billion. An increase of 37 to 40%. We expect revenue to be in the range of 6.85 to 6.9 billion and increase of 25%. We expect product revenue to be in the mid to high single digit percent range year over year. We expect fiscal 23 operating margins to be in the range of 19 to 19.5% which is 50 basis points ahead of the range. We provided a fiscal full fiscal 22 and consistent with the growth targets we presented to our fiscal. During our physical year 21 analyst day. We expect non-gap eps to be in the range of 9.40 to 950. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 33.5 to. 33.5 to 34.5%. We expect to be got profitable for fiscal year 2023. Regarding our fiscal year. 24 financial targets which we outlined that our september 21st day we have strong confidence in achieving those objectives and we hope you take away from our call today some of the reasons behind this confidence. Additionally please consider the following modeling points. We expect approximately 42% of our operating income to come in the first half of the fiscal year and approximately 58% in the second half. We expect a longer tax rate to remain at 22%. If you want in fiscal year 23 subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. 2123 we expect not interested in other income of. 6 to 8 million. We expect q123 diluted chairs outstanding of 108 to 110 million. We expect. Fiscal year 23 diluted chairs outstanding of 111 to 113 million chairs. We expect the q1 capital expenditures of 35 to 40 million. And we expect fiscal year 23 capital expenditures of 190 to 200 million. And finally as in cash noted we announced today a 3 for 1 split of palo alto networks common stock. The decision was driven by a desire to make a stock more accessible to our employees and the broader group of investors. Is also supported by our underlying confidence in our continued business. Momentum. Shareholders of record at the close of business on september 6th 2022 will receive two additional shares after the close of business on september 13th. 2022. Every outstanding share hold on september 6. A stock will be in traded on trading on. Split adjusted basis on september 14th 2022. With that i will turn the call back over to clay for the q&a portion of the call. Great thank you deepak to allow for broad participation i would ask that each person ask only one. Question the first question comes from hamza potterwal or morgan stanley with rob owns to follow hamza please ask your question. Thanks guys thank you for taking my question and a really nice set of results. Deepak just a clarification question for you real quick. Did you say that the billings growth and q4 would have been mid to high 30s. Excluding the estimated pull forward. And then also for. The cash you mentioned some early macro commentary about. Longer duration deals. Are you also seeing any changes in the sales cycle as you guys do more 7/8 figure 9 deals and. Is that reflecting the guidance at all. I just don't know keep it ever since you have time yeah see if i did say that if some of the is important. Not just full forwards we had some large long duration deals. I can normalize for them we just want to make sure we set expectations of next year the 44 was exceptional. And some of that was because of some large longer duration deals i mean normalized for that then you'd end up in the mid to high 30 so this is more precautionary in our part as opposed to. I'm telling you that we're not doing well on the front of you know like. Real life cycle have been elongating at the top end of the market for us as the deal size of grown this is not net new to us this has been happening over the last two or three years you know when i came the largest deal with it was 28 million dollars now we've done deals closer to $100 obviously it takes a longer time to get $100 deal in place and requires a lot more validation from our customers poc isn't getting engaged so. That trend is consistent we have not seen. Any. In that driven by economic factors that is your question. As i said the three effects we saw we shared a little sweating of hardware assets to. Push them out a little longer. Have you seen some people. Look at transformation project you can see them not go away from transformation we've seen consol. Thank you. Great next question from rob owens of piper sandler with phil winso to fall rob take it away. Great thanks for taking my question would love to drill down into the success you guys are seeing in prismacloud. And what is the biggest factors and or technical differentiation that's driving your success right now. Let me give you a set of overarching picture and lee has been kind enough to at least at least they did not product or capabilities but like. Very quickly we're noticing that if you go out look that it's hundreds of billions of cloud being sold by our cloud service providers the top five around the world. What is becoming clear is most of the top end or large customers are in multiple clouds they're not just in one we ourselves are in gcp and aws instances in the liberate of azure so we're seeing ourselves in multi-cl. So. That multi-cloud. Development. Is causing customers to look for a multi-cloud solution. And you know that's normally not driven by one cloud service providers typically somebody like us that's one part of it. The other part is. You know if the customer looking for point solution it's harder for us but most customers are migrating away from point solutions looking for a more platform approach as lee highlighted in which bridge crew which we acquired. Operates on the left side of the developing life cycle it's the bills life. Where's my cloud used to traditionally operate in the run cycle where you put things in the production. By connecting build and run and if you've created the sort of even the extension to the developing life cycle so we are seeing people who are taking a serious view towards cyber security in the cloud come to palo alto networks and not chase some point solutions look at the. There are no platform solutions available you know. Most industry groups have already validated that as the sc awards we heard about this morning so. Did you want. Technical. You been well trained to guess i'll add one piece. And actually to catch that is prepared remarks. Not only do we have a platform approach but everything that we deliver from the platform is best in class. And that that combination is is critically important. For customers to have the trust and confidence in using prison cloud. All right thanks. Great text to bill winslow credit suisse with adam to follow phil go ahead. Hey congratulations on a great into the fiscal year now when we speak to your partners a growing message back has been that increasing amount of demand for prisma access which obviously had a great quarters coming from enterprises that have been customers of other competing on-premise fireball vendors. Over the do not offer as robust a set of cloud services call out and that works doesn't and lead to your point during your slides the number that jumped out at us today was that more than 30% of new sassy logos in q4 were new to the house and network so they catch them maybe lee if you could come in too if you think forward here what is opportunity not only monetize sassy because my access but also potentially transition that largely on premise install base of those competing firewall vendors 2 networks platform what do you hear from customers and why. I feel i think in the last. Yeah i would say audibility to deliver deploy and sell sassy has grown. And as you as you picked up in the number 30 because these customers are net new to palo. And the way it works is we go to them they appreciate our firewalls but the problem is there now have bought firewalls from somebody two years ago 3 years ago 5 years ago and there's still a lot end of life on them so they like us they like our solutions but they're not able to execute because somebody before them bought them or they bought them at a moment when they were deleted you know so. Now comes the point where we are able to convince them that our sasuke solution is right. Our excitement for these 30% customers is that over time they will then migrate their own prime hardware to volatile as well. Ever noticing early days but noticing some of these customers about our sassy solution because they understand our security fabric then have deployed it and it's a simple attached for putting hardware because security solutions have already been put into place so you know we have taken. Share in the firewall market by by most third party estimates over. 3400 basis point. Everything part of the driver is us being able to deliver a more comprehensive zero trust network security capability at lehighlighted we have customers who spend north of 100 million dollars of. Lifetime value of network security with us which is hard to do. Great next is adam title of raymond james with brian essex. Okay thank you very much the cash on the ngs portfolio congrats on the success you're just under 2 billion at this point i thought i'd maybe touch on the growth versus profitability algorithm for that piece of the business now that it's at this level of scare up scale. If i look at the physical 23 guidance it implies that new ngs arr is going to be just over 700 million which is a big number. But it's about the same dollar amount as you added in physical 22. Could you give me speak to kind of this crossroads of opportunity to invest more for ngs arr and maybe a new step function level of new ar grow. Versus is it a better opportunity now to harvest and improve profitability. And certainly any metrics you can provide on where you are and where you can go. And yes profitability would be great thank you. I'm sorry i'm confused are you saying 50 60% growth it's time to harvest or time to grow faster. Sometimes i can never make you guys happy. It is like 3 years ago we said a billion you guys like holy shit that's a big number you won't get there we get to 1.9 billion in four years and she didn't say that's that's all for the course now just like start making more money. As a lee highlighted we are trying to balance our r&d spend. With our growth aspirations. I personally believe there's so much room in the cyber security market as we've demonstrated being a since i came we've. Gravity girls is up 50%. I am trying to percentage growth so i used to grow in the 1920s and you're going to 20 or 29%. I think that's a good place it's such large numbers we're going at a good number we're going to keep balancing our investment yet showing you fiscal pr. Could i go spend more money and let the operating margin language lower. I don't want to i will promise that we keep extracting. I'll bring margin. To make sure we're fiscally prudent and we're going to do that but at the same time we use the opportunity of every dollar to make it more efficient and keep spending for growth. We. There are good profile obviously as you would expect has improve. For most of our products that we were taking bets on about 3 or 4 years ago. I think so important in the sand in the arr is a leading indicator of revenue. So. Revenue comes in after a hour and then your cost come in there on day one. So yes our opening margins for these new areas are getting better in some cases getting deposited from negative. But i think we're still further away until you see the impact of the 70,000 we added this year as that flows into revenue the next 700 frozen revenue will hopefully will keep expanding operating modules which is fueling our ability to give you that 50 basis point expansion over the years but we're going to keep striking the balance. Right next is brian essex of golden sachs with the team of milani to follow go ahead and bring. Great thank you for taking the question and i'll let go my congratulations on the results as well great to see. Maybe the cash if you could help us reconcile what you're saying on the product revenue side particularly within the context of your guidance next year. Particularly given what you said about you know consolidating sharing your platform early stages of refresh cycle but it sounds like you know you got some great bm series transaction and. The percentage of revenue of total follows a platform. Businesses is you know accelerating. What are the underlying assumptions behind that you know. Mid high single digit product revenue growth where could you see upside. How are things different. Underline those expectations. Compared to what you're saying today. Everybody thank you for the question and thank you for your for your kind words look. We had the similar set of expectations last year going into the fiscal year. And we benefited from some price increases as you know. She also benefited from. Going to pull through activities by customers because they were supply chain prices and people were trying to make sure they're talking stocking up you just want to be prudent we don't anticipate more price increases because our philosophy is we don't want to keep driving prices up. Because you know when you keep increasing prices when supply chain settles down you have to cut prices and i don't want to be in that scenario or we're showing you tremendous volatility in our product revenue so that's got a one factor is the price normalization the second factor is potential pulling by customers because of. Supply chain constraints and ordering ahead if you balance that out we think the number still in the load of high single digits but again as i've told you from perhaps. 5 years ago. We are focusing on firewall as a platform the more i drive sassy the more i drive virtual firewalls. The better off we are is transitioning our business is going to be highlighted 70% of our revenue now it's predictable going to the next quarter we highlighted that 80% of our software subscription is coming from. From software so we are trying to make sure we keep transforming this business and software because we love our hardware business it drives a lot of it's installed base and lies and lots of refreshes it drives a lot of our advance your advanced prevention capabilities so please don't take away that that's not not a favorite child of ours but at the same time. Yeah we are cautious. And we're making sure we balance the growth in a hardware business with a trust we're putting into sassy and cloud. Very helpful thank you. A text from fatima milani of citigroup with socket clia next go ahead fatima. Thank you good afternoon gentlemen thanks for taking my questions for you you know. If i calculate in a rough back of the envelope. You had roughly maybe 10% of your billings tied to a handful of transactions so as i think about large deal dependency and $7,500 million deals becoming the norm at palo alto how do you put your head together with the. Serpent guardrails around the guidance as the business becomes a little bit more levered to some of these larger deals especially given your scale. Oh really really like a first of all i get up we were careful we said mid to high 30 so it's not exactly 10% it's somewhere between 5 and 8% if you will. If you're getting back on the amount envelope. But yes 58% but look part of it is we also told we have 1200 millionaire. Cuz i think in cyber security that makes us the largest number of millionaire customers you can expect. There's a large. Amount of customers between that. And. The million dollar customer is 100 million there's a lot of people that have lots of numbers between 100 so you can expect we have people pretty much it every number. Part of it is a balancing act in terms of what deals we prioritize what deals we focus on remember $100 deals don't go away. Just take longer. So we can get it done in q1 we'll get it done in q2 and some customer doesn't wake up one morning say you know that deal we've been discussing the last 9 months. I is not going to happen it typically it's becomes a $60 deal or is it going to happen to fold. It's our job is to have a lot more pipeline in our portfolio to make sure that we're able to bring enough of them in to be able to keep you. Hungry eyes away from. Destroying our our credibility or whatever the right phr. Everybody convinced yet fatima or not. I'm still waiting. I'm on the bullet train. All right good fantastic thank you. All right great thanks so next question from socket cle. The barclays with brentville next go ahead sock. Okay great thanks. Hey everyone thanks thanks for taking my my question here echo my congrats on on a very strong quarter. Deepak maybe maybe for you. You know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you took the same approach with fy23 guide. As you did with with fy22 which is obviously very strong. So maybe the question for you is as we all contemplate the impact of macro uncertainty for next year. How did you sort of think about that when when you were kind of thinking about that that billings died for next year which again was very strong of a higher base for 22. Yeah i don't think there's anything different than i'm going to tell you second that that's already that's not already in our prepared remarks i mean i think it's really a question of just dissecting what are the impact. Of the macro. And figuring out what supply chain related what's inflation related. Demand related. And then just making sure that we methodically work through it like. The cash and i in the leadership team has a lot of debates might you in the course of the annual planning process and then we just try to make sure that. Thinking through scenarios and having enough flexibility for. Different scenarios but. Really nothing to be on the. Apartment. Thank you. A great next is brentville of jeffries with andy nowitzki next to have brett. Hey guys you have joe hunter brad appreciate the question and congrats on the results maybe just a follow up to that last question appreciate the extra prudence and i know that it's your physical first quarter but. Is there any reason why the growth rate would have. I know there's some duration in 40 but just maybe talk about the billings guidance is early stuff thank you. So i i think again ultimately we talked about how you got to normalize it for some large deals we did able to take a price increase. On august. I think again we're just trying to be prudent at the beginning of the fiscal year. And make sure that we're not getting ahead of our skis i mean. The 21% is is the fiscally a guy that i think we've got a little bit higher in q1. Specifically but i think. Yeah and still had a consensus so i think. We feel pretty good about the the pipeline all the metrics that we look at order to understand the overall market context you got companies which are reducing guidance companies that you're cutting ups guidance their companies which are warning of potential customer. Ideal life cycles being smaller so we were trying to make sure that we're prepared for both the upside and downside scenario i think it's fair for us to be proven in that market. Makes sense thanks guys. Hey great next we got andy nowinsky of wells fargo until fish find next go ahead. Great. First i just want to extend my congrats on a great quarter in the billings guidance particularly in light of the much harder comp you have this year so for a question i wanted to ask about your win rates on prisma sassy because none of your competitors have firewalls or other solutions to offer beyond their sassy sol. I'm wondering if the rest of your portfolio might actually be your most sustainable. Competitive advantage that's driving that growth in new logos you're seeing with prison sassy. Honey i think part of if you look at historically. You know until about 3 years ago we didn't have a sassy product that we could actually go head to head with. Industry leader let's. What is happening last year and a half or two. We've become the force to reckon with i'd say. In the. The largest enterprise deal is had to head to vend. They really do we see a third it doesn't take a lot to guess who the second render is. Yeah tears go we're not showing up to the party two years ago getting one or two deals out of 10 i would think we're in five to six out of 10 deals in our aspiration is next year to be in 10 out of 10 deals. You know. Hopefully. No if you can win half the deals that were in. Will be going out big numbers i created this year so. We think we are coming of age in our sassy business then we have a lot of respect for the other player in the market. I always think we have a better solution technically. We're seeing that when enterprise architectures come to play with customers want to integrate is zero trust strategy across hardware software and. Remote access driven. Solutions we believe that we have a technical edge the same time we made the early decision to deploy that on the public cloud we have actually are the only company that can deliver your sassy solution on the public cloud with redundancy so gcp goes down we auto hot switch to awf is everybody else goes down with hot stretch so we give you the highest level sla in the sassy business in the market today. Great thanks to cash. Right next we got joel fishbein of tourist securities followed by keith buckman go ahead joe. All right. We're going to. If you want more shot here jo. Sorry about that sorry about that thanks for taking my question i was on mute. On the cash just wanted to follow up on on fed spending in sled spending particularly since palo alto is probably in the pool position to. Deal with the zero trust environment that the federal governments you know espousing a strategy around and i would love to just get an update it seems like there's a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of spending. Okay joy you guys will appreciate what typically happens when you administration comes into place the first 6 months they spend the time getting to know each other. The next 6 months that are a lot of executive orders and then again to implementation if you're lucky in here too. So yes we have seen a great signs of alignment in the fed market we have seen some good executive orders that line towards more awareness around cybersecurity as you know the sec is also looking at it how to make it a more. Relevant conversation and boards so all the signs are headed in the right direction the fiscalier closed for fed comes in the next month and a half. So let me show hopefully see some activity in q1 around that and i think next year should be a better year for fed spending especially around zero trust and sassy and cloud. Great thank you. All right. I just keep talking to bmo with greg mosquez. Hey can you hear me okay yep. Straight leah want to bring you into the conversation for a second if i could. Lots of good metrics around cortex. And i was just wondering how you're thinking about the growth potential in cortex. And particularly with x i am coming in the first half. Does that you think actually cause an acceleration and growth and cortex. Empty pack if i could just ask a clarification sneak one in here. For the billings guide are are you assuming. Duration neutral in fy23. Or any kind of assumptions around duration and newt and pricing that we should be thinking about in that 20 to 21. Billings guide when you compare this year to last year many thanks. Yeah thanks thanks for the question keith. We saw. Another year of good traction with cortex across xdrx or an expans. And i anticipate that will continue to see. Oh that traction fy23 given the. The product innovation that we we've driven and will continue to drive across those three products and the value they provide. You know when i think about x i am i think of it as being a. The start of. Fairly exciting journey but it's going to be a multi-year journey i don't i don't see it as as being just a quick hit it's a it's a more architectural transformation. It is truly what i believe customers need. But it will take a little bit longer for that to fully play out and. I am. Very encouraged by the design partner program we ran. But there's we're going to see that play out over the course the next year and hopefully that sets the foundation for years to. Okay great. And just just want to see a question on duration pricing no significant changes on duration and. Additional pricing beyond the ones that we've already announced recall august 1st we did have the price increase that was about 5% on. La habra. Okay great many thanks. Exit. All right greg moskowitz missoula securities followed by matt hedberg. So we outlined that we it's hard to do m&a now than it was three or four years ago because we had such a wide. Canvas or blind canvas in terms of various opportunities where we could go make acquisitions today we have to we have to balance the idea of an acquisition. To make sure that is is it consistent with our product strategy and is it an overlapping acquisition or is it a. In a complimentary acquisition we can integrate over time so that reduces the amount of the opportunity out there and i always said we're very focused on product area acquisitions as opposed to go to market acquisitions because we have it as you can see from our error or ngs 1.9 billion we had the ability to go sell good stuff. If we got good stuff from our product. I think we will continue to stay on the lookout and scan the market we are not we're not. In the mindset of acquiring. Large deals were in the mindset of looking for great product teams that we can complementally attach to our capabilities so we keep scanning the market is something shows up. We'll do it but again i don't think. It has ever been a significant part of our effort in terms of our market cap and when we did. First in half billion dollars a more he got was 20-25 so you can imagine it's a small scale relative to what the opportunity. Honey and that's why we think about it we're not we're not jumping at the bit right now. Market. I think it's kind of like. The public market has. As rationalized the private market is probably haven't yet. It's been like real estate. I know people remember the loss of the neighbor's house what it sold at they kind of forget what their houses worth so until people realize the true value their house. It's going to be a little longer before. Acquisitions come into the security market. Getting ready matt hedberg rbc followed by great paul atwood. Congrats on the results. You know the success of your sassy portfolio is obviously impressive. I'm wondering if you approach new fiscal year are there things that you're doing from a go to market perspective. To even you know drive higher cross sell at least you have about 54,000 firewall customers and now just shy of 3,600 sassy custom. It's kind of curious how you think about maybe you know driving even more crossover. I'm at thank you thank you for the question it's a great question. It's something our management team has spent a lot of time thinking about. And. What we are doing going into this fiscal year. Is used to have sassy sales specialists. And what you've done is we have. Merge them into our core sales team and we've been running boot camps the last 6 to 8 weeks. Training everybody out in the field for sassy so we're converting our entire core field team or network security team into sassy first team. Which is the way only way we can get an amplification across 2000 sellers and actually go make sure there's a sassy opportunity to be uncovered every customer so we think sassy has come of age we think sassy is the linchpin towards our network security strategy we think there's this is going to be a very very large market. In the next. 5 to 10 years everything were one of two vendors in the market who will be invited to every opportunity and we hope to win our. Best of luck thank you. Thanks yeah great our last question for the day from gray powell with pti go ahead. Look great as i said. First and foremost the large complex deals take longer to get done and sassy does take longer because custom. Yes that's just not buying a security in baltimore get on it's actually re-architecting your network access. Actually this is how your laptop dolls in into your work if you're using palo alto sassy or prisma sassy so it's kind of important because if your laptop doesn't get access to pti g's infrastructure in trouble so it becomes an. Network play as much as the security place or teams take a little longer to get it done so i think that's kind of part of the process less so the macroeconomic concerns if you will is really it's really doing the technology transformation agreeing to do it as an organization. That's what takes a little longer. In terms of our guidance like there's a whole bunch of. Put some dates that are going in there they're secular tailwinds we obviously have a sense of the pipeline going the next year and as fatima asked we did some big deals guess what we didn't do some big deals right you couldn't have done every deal so there's a bunch of deals that are still waiting in the wings yes they're larger and they're binary that if they all don't come in we'll have to go hustle if they all come and we'll be in a great place but our job is management is balance all these factors you got to balance infl. Supply chain. You know deal cycles various product investment so i think across the balance if you look. We think our guidance is prudent across all these factors where we seen some of them might be better for us some of them they may be worse part of the margin we think we can deliver the guidance as as presented to. Great thanks that will conclude our q&a i'll turn it back over to the cash for his closing tomorrow. Well first of all thank you everyone for your attention and your questions and for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you after this. Separate calls as well as upcoming conferences i also want to thank our customers partners and of course most of all our employees who make us the great place that we. That go follow the network.
