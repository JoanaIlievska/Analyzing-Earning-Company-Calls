One hello everyone welcome to the presentation meeting for the half results of alton. For those of you follow us online you can ask you a question directly on the platform for those of you are in the room of course the q&a session will be held at the end of the presentation so i give the floor to see more zulily chairman of alton thank you and. Hello everyone. I'm very happy to be here to present to you. The results of the first half 2022. I was hoping. That i had a full room today we thought. During the board meeting that's in a period of post covered everybody could be here so i'm very. Surprised to see that people are still following online and not attending in presents so i believe that they'll be probably 30% of us in the room and the rest. Following us a remotely which give us a trend for the next meet. In any event you are all here. Even online. And we're very happy to present to you the results and the strategy for 2022 and the two coming years. The results were published yesterday. As you can see and i hope it is not a big surprise for you. The gro. Is here. The results are good we've already published the revenue at the end of july. We have a very good surprise however is that our forecast. That we presented to you a few months ago. Did not allow us to. Such. A high level of 11.4%. Considering the the pressure that we had on the headcount. Since the beginning of the year so we didn't know how it would affect. Dra. So two phenomenon helped. To produce this number of very strong demand. And a deficit of engineers that is everywhere in the world including in low cost countries asia eastern europe. Or north africa. That has. Led to. The fact that clients had to do something about it because they were facing this deficit. Of engineers so it limited. The number of inter internal contracts. And so we can announce 11.4%. The calendar will be less favorable on h2 and bruno will talk about it but it's going to be between 10:00 and 10.5%. We end the the half year. With 43,650 engineers. Which means the 49,600 employees. This number has been outgrown already today and are ambition. Would have been to present to you the magic number of 50,000. Engine. In december 2022. We hope it's still going to be possible it's going to be. Difficult. Depending on the m&a activity it might be possible our international growth. Is the. Getting stronger even if prince is very good results as you can see on the map. Today. International footprint is at 67%. And if we have these 50,000 engineers will be at 30% in france and 70%. Internationally. So all the scopes all the geographic scopes have grown a different bases. But you could see that. It's a very positive the organ. Organic growth and external gross as well. External growth has been less strong than last year it's been mostly recovery. Off from organic growth fr. That has not had external growth has recuperated as you can see on the graph. Going for 10. Six of five of 6,550 engineers up to 10,800 engineers for this year which is quite a miracle. For such a year so. Of course you will have this charts later on and you'll have a chance to. Analyze it deeper on our. But globally you have to remember that. There's no. Geographic difference. Old countries. Have the same issue. Of not finding enough engineers and this is going to stay unfortunately the loss of engineers. The deficit of engineer is going to be here to stay. So i would like to insist. On. This on two types the breakdown between two types of activity that really correct rise the peculiarity of the alton group. For those of you who i have met before. We have two jobs in the world of services there's a blue job and the yellow job. So this is what i'll send calls them and. The blue or michi is the all the engineering services everything that is designed and deployment of products that are going to be sold so it's a core business of our clients. And the yellow meeting is everything. That is it enterprises services apps databases and networks deploying the networks the cloud cyber security etc. So blue is technical management and production management yellow is internal needs. That you find in most companies. Blue is engineering it's all 10 yellow is the all the. Companies the subsidiary specialized in consulting and expertise. So what if we are in the blue if i core business is in the blue why we're doing in the yellow. Parts because. Since the digitalization calls for. Develop specific development and very technical developments were requested from banks insurances or retail to develop particular apps that we know how to do in the world of products. The embedded the embark to software that we. Have developed for the last 30 or 40 years in the group all 10. And it's mostly the engineering companies that are requested to develop specific. Product. In the world of it services of companies. But there are many things that will not do in the yellow world. We won't do what is called bpo it's taking a whole payroll and crm with the audits and the analysis and training and deployment in india this is not our core business our business is to design with teams of engineers products. With their specifications same goes with the networks of companies who are requested many times to. To do something about this. But would say that i'll ten is an engineering company at 70% and uses its technical skills to. Offer a specific developments and technical developments to the world. To the internal functions of companies. In the world of the engineering there are two branches the branch r&d. Design. Up to the prototypes. And the manufacturing branch. The manufacturing branch alton was not present on that branch. 15 years ago because the plants were 2.0 it was a lot of blue colors a lot of. People management and since the factories have become more and more digitalized. It's the the automation of plants with the iot. And everything that's a generates. Has. Helped. As helped us so think about it differently on how we can deliver. Industrial equipments. And we have again need for engineers. And we develop more and more on the world of manufacturing. In the 70% that we have today it represents maybe 45% for r&d. And 25% for manufacturing and production engineering engineering. Whether it's real telecom energy. Sectors. I hope that helps you understand better how elton is positioned. And the fact that alton is the only real world operator. Independent. With a mindsets. An engineer. And it's a reality of today that our clients are very aware of. And that's why they want our services. So what's a characterizes alternate as well it's two other points. I often present this slider sometimes i do sometimes i don't but i always insist on the fact. That alton focuses. On specific studies. Whether it's for rd or for manufacturing. Or for special applications of it services. On the jobs of engineering and specific developments. We recruit. Only engineers. And they're all on our payroll. So we are very. High investments in recruiting and managing the careers of these engineers. And they will help them grow to a functions of specialists of experts project leaders or business unit managers. Which is what you see on the level two and three of the slide. We work in technical assistance with the clients who asked us for additional resources but more and more the clients. Are giving us the entirety of the project the projects that we manage in our premises or sometimes in the development centers abroad. If they ask for low cost prices in romania or in india. And it's 70% 70% of our revenue in france. Is the 100% worldwide we have the responsibility. For the project for the management of the project we don't do the level one. Which we call stuffing. Or freelancing this market food there's some freelance companies staffing companies it's grown quite a lot in the us. Because of much more liberal work law. We don't do the level 4 either that could. Be compromising us with our clients. Because some of our clients do it themselves so we have our own test centers. And so we don't want to be a competing with a tire one. If they sell their own services to industrial companies so we're not on level four. And level four would not allow us to. Manage on the semester basis. Profit rates depending on we manage all that. Coming to counting point of view. Over the four possibilities of. The service offer we are on level 2 and 3 we want to work. With industrial companies. In banks. And for major industries. For 72% of. Revenue. In the area of technical. Products and services. I think it's clear enough but i'm happy to go back on it. So now. We on the breakdown by sector of our revenue. This is the logical consequence of the strategy as you can see where 70%. In the world of technical and engineering products. 20%. Approximately land transport automotive and rail. It's about it's pretty stable where. We grew a bit even in the aerospace and security and novel world. Departments. And then you have all the other technical equipments around the energy life science telecom. Electronics where you have about each of them representing about 10% and then you have the remaining 25 28% which because of it's grown. In the services sector bank and insurance. So how. How does it work with all these sectors. Still doing very well but i want to see some fact that during each crisis only one or two sectors were hit so it's very strategic. For the alton group. To have this diversity of sectors. We're number one. In the engineering sector as an independent structure. But we are also one of the only companies that is multisectoral in the engineering world. Which is that we have. We work on number of sectors and that has prevented us from being hit. During doing all the crisis. We were hit pretty bad. By the crisis of the internet bubble because we worked. A lot in the telecom sector. We suffered for a semester but because the other sectors were doing fine we. We could come overcome that the 2009 crisis as well automotive as well. But at the same time the aerospace sector was doing well so it saved us the crisis the covid crisis we were hit of course in the aerospace sector. We had a drop of 60% of the revenue. In aeronautics and for the equipment manufacturers or do you automotive companies suffered a bit but the other sectors held up pretty well so this diversity of sectors is fundamental for us to protect us from the crisis and so we're not depending on only one sector. It's a form of guarantee but it implies that we have a critical size in each country and each sector. So we have that and that's why we need this number of 50,000 engineers i'm going to say a word on each sector but in the next slides i'm not going to want to take them. All of them you have more details on. How each sector is characterized defense defense sector is the market that is doing very well we have a lot of requests from most defense operators saffron tellers and the others. Or leonardo. It would note 6 the sector. Came back to the level pre-covid. With new projects such as the hydrogen plane the revamping of a number. For existing models. Which means in fact that they're completely redone from the inside. Even if the outside is not changed with new engines. So it's a sector we will have quite a good visibility and we can expect a nice growth for the next two years. Regarding the sector of automotive in the rail. In the automotive sector we have a lot of requests we managed to work. With most of french german-american. And swedish car manufacturers. So that protected us because it's a tough sector very high pressure on the prices they consider it in the automobile sector. That engineering is part of the cost of production cost. And before. Before they look at the quality they look at the price first. And there's a bigger pressure on offshoring of all the car. That services. The r&d of the automotive sector is not strategic as it could be in the aeronautics or defense sector. So. They go to the manila philippines morocco. India. And we have delivery center in those countries. It's a little as true for real. A navel sectors. We have. Many requests from the sector. On the engines and the network. And also on the. The layouts there's so many big sites. We were we were working with major players and that's open some very nice perspectives of development as well on the sector. For the other sectors that we call other industries which is energy life science. Telecoms. Energy is do we have a major project on the nuclear energy as you can imagine. We operate in france very well. We know that we're going to have some major investment in the south of france england and nordics were preparing for that. We are expecting for the nuclear side. A gross of 50% and increase of 50% of our revenue. In the sector. Because we have the right skills and we must conquer new activities in the energy sector where we are less present which is more network deploying the net the grid. Playing the grid and renewable energies. We have a footprint in this network but not enough. Regarding the life science. I can imagine how busy the sector is. It's mostly pharmaceutical industry. And the medical instruments. We decided 7 or 8 years ago to. Be present on this market that we believed first was more. Meant for different type of companies because we're not biologists we're engineers but we realize that there are many big needs. On the the two sides of the pharmaceutical groups on the one hand. Data treatment of the clinical trials. Where we grew up very strongly it's data and certification together. And on manufacturing because. They need. Quality and traceability. Such as in the special industry and we realized that we were quite needed in those sectors and we grew them. Quite a bit. The only limit to our development is not the market is its capacity of training specialist and business managers. To develop those products. So in terms of industrial equipment and electronics. Villas. Tool machine tools we work on two countries mostly never on all of. All of countries and we need to deploy what we. Need what we know to do. Flagship countries. What i say also applies to the telecoms industry. We operate mostly on deploying 4g 5g that works on two countries. So those those two sectors offer very nice perspective we don't expect any crisis to come so it's up to us to capture all these but all these potential. Everything that is the digitalization in the retail or sector. And services media and public sector. Is the needs a lot of services. An engineers. It's a completely underserved and it's up to us to. Get into this market. And in this yellow world we can see that the wages have been going up very much because the cios. Have need the company to run. So everything that is web and web marketing they have to put in place no matter the cost. So this is the organization for sector. Let you read over what i just said on those two three slides that are coming up it's the same thing but it's just a. Broken down then you have the percentage of our activities. In percentage of revenue but you have to just keep in mind that everything is going well and if there's a major crisis in a sector. Despite the warnings that we have. When we hear all the economy the world economy is going to collapse so there's going to be a global crisis but on our own positioning and on our specific dna. Which is to conduct products projects with engineers that we manage from a to z. Our market is our limits and our clients are asking us to do more and more. Okay. A word on. Good competition. Of course things have changed a bit in the last 4 to 5 years you find our new actors now they're two different types of major players you have the big it companies that cap accenture they try to penetrate on market they have made some acquisitions like. I'll try. They are penetrating the market with a very over the business approach that is very different than the one that is now that we have now. They are used to as a major player of the world of the it services. And management it to take bpos where we call bpos which are processes with 300 and 400 people. Like telling okay we're going to handle all your payroll your accounting women you're going to manage all your tools including the crm. From top to bottom with. In all the countries that you have worldwide it doesn't work that way in the engineering sector because we look at the core business of the clients and specifics the client only externalize 30% of his needs. For additional. Resources because this needs. Evolved depending on the new projects and the new equipment that he's working on. And for technological needs if he doesn't have them but we stay in his core business and he keeps in charge he stays in charge of his business. Car manufacturer is not going to externalize a car. Or full engine. It's not the way it works in the industry. So globally we. This competition. It's not scary to us because. It doesn't fit the approach to the engineering world. What we could be. Frighten off. With these new competitors is there offshore capacities mostly in india because these are not companies they're no french companies anymore american companies anymore they are legally indian companies half of their payroll or in india. So they come to the market and they tell the client so we can do anything you want in india from india. So. We said that there's a. Vicenter of offshoring indian engineering world. But we're not letting us letting it frighten us so we gained a lot of new markets in the offshoring including in india against these actors because the clients knows. Locally. And our local footprints in europe. In france or in europe or in the us is very reshowing for clients then you have the indian clients there's strategy is to do nothing locally. So if you dress the engineering sector the client needs. A minimum at least 30% if it's not 70% of local activities. Versus 30 to 70%. Offshoring in low cost countries. But the strategy of the indian actors is to do nothing locally to have sales. The local sales that to bring back all the countries to india. So the strategy that generates less overhead of course because all the overheads are in india. They have 20 points. Already more versus in the engineering the local engineering model and we are first of the class first in class. It's 10%. How far away because all the structures are local and the hr management is done by local engineers based in europe or in the us. So it's a different type of competition. Are we going to end the question is are we going to see everything. But being brought back in india. But it's not it's in the model is i gain the market and i bring it back to india. And then. We saw. Interim and staffing companies i don't want to make any comments on that we are watching them and we're going to see how they how they evolve. The engineering is not compatible with staffing if you're doing project management you need a super strong technical management it won't be done by staffing or freelancers or people who will not be loyal to the company. I'm not saying that there are competitors but it's a financial operator. Private equity fun. You have seen that the it market. Is developing of course there are many private. Equity of fun. I'm carrying out the build. Of course these are not all success stories but they are. Gaining in size and the objective is to be bought back at the very. So they basically they present operations with a four five 10,000 people with basically no other value trying to make profit. Make profits on the. First acquisition. M&a usually are the 30 to 50% and more expensive than we are and these has a really impacted our. Potential especially externally because when they do an acquisition they. Lock management and we will absolutely crazy system so which is not something that we want to do when we design our strategy. So these are not fully fledged players from a technical point of view but rather they are troublesome players when it comes to carrying out our own policy. But let me repeat that alton is in a unique position and we should make sure that we see this opportunity to develop ourselves because the market is present is responding correctly and we will have to make sure that we will be able to respond. We have the implemented over the past of 4 years at this. Approach we have a cross-cutting. Structures so we have a worldwide approach especially at the sales level this is absolutely necessary. We cannot come up with these methods in all of the. Eyes of christ so we had to invest massively in france for example to be able to then develop them in germany the uk and the rest of europe and the sales. Direction is also something that has to be thought through. It cannot be done in any dependent manner because in the majority of our clients are a multinationals we can't have airbus in france in germany and spain in the uk and so on and so forth we have one global client at stellantis is the same. When it's a merge with fiat chrysler we had to adopt our method to have one un. We had to coordinate our actions with the italians and the americans which was not an easy task but this is the real challenge that we have but it is also an opportunity for us to attract more international clients. And then we also need to take stock of our assets a worldwide so that we can present them to our clients. Alton is not only a service a provider which until a few years ago actually had the capacity to carry out projects with the robust teams alton has also now become a company which has a very strong author in various sectors and our offering is a really impressive to our clients we need to do better when it comes to marketing so that we can actually. Step up our game. And we will need to concentrate on our cross cutting structures which will have to be further develop. The financial health of the alton group. Also allows us to carry out all the acquisitions that we want to. But. Unfortunately doesn't mean that we always use it to it's the best. Oh the companies that we could be interested in today are already in part managed by a private. Defines or are very expensive. Or. Sometimes the price is way beyond our value on the stock market so this would be very damageable for us. If it were a very strategic mood then we would be ready to do so but it has not been the case so far. So we would need to find a very strategic move to carry to move forward with this and maybe it will happen in the future. So as you can see the m e n a i includes. A head count of between 300 and 800 people. But this is not really what happened this year with the exception of an indian. Or rather an american company. Which. Carries out a project with the delivery center in india. This has come and complimented that were offshore capabilities there was a larger company in the uk and then we had. Together positions of more modest the science companies in spain and australia. We are currently a negotiating with some companies and we want to strengthen our position in some sectors as. Before we do not have a critical size or mass in some countries and some sectors for example the uk or spain. India us we need to make sure that we can strengthen our position. Many companies are used. To working with delivery centers in india so this is something that we have. Think about. We also have an advice company and the local engineering companies in this sense we need to think about our positioning. Usually we concentrate on engineering and not. Advice. Because of the average age of our engineers is around 30 years old and our image is to provide the engineering solutions and not advice. A services so again this is going to maybe change our. A positioning or. I hope that we won't be able to. Make some to give you some good news in the future we have a lot going on in the parking lot in the pipeline but unfortunately negotiations are sometimes difficult. We are hoping that the current situation internationally will be will benefit. Now regarding. Capital. Our set holder base it has not changed. Approximately 83% in the public sector. And then we can see also some. Pictures being owned by fpc. Fcp i bet your pond and austin. And so employees and. I need to raise managers. And approximately a 15% of the capital is detained by. I said a few years ago that i wanted to see that at least 5% of my strays to benefit charities but unfortunately i can't do that given the current situation. So now i'm going to give the fuel to bruno so that we can have a closer look at the. Results. Good morning. As the usual i like to start with this slide because you can see at the developments in the growth of the group. You can see that there was a slight slow down in 2020 for up this reason but you can see that the since the 2015 the group as a whole has almost doubled in size. You can see the evolution of our revenue. You can also see that in terms of headcount the group has a significantly. Grown in 2022 because we went from. I have 42,32021 and we are almost at 50,000 today. With three of a 43. 1650 engine. In the first half of the year. We have a recruited $6,500. 3,500 people. Have joined the main in the mini region because we bought a company in china and india and they represent the $2,700 engineers out of the 3,500 that i mentioned. In the first half of the year we also recruited an additional $3,440 engineers. Even though we would need more. So 450 in france is so less than internationally because internationally we are recruited approximately 3,000. As usual here you can see the analysis of the changes in the revenue with like for like on the light for light light for light faces. You can see that. Cynthia. First to the half of the year 2021 the growth has been the robust and has not declined we have we are around 20%. The organic growth is the first growth driver of the group because it is the main driver as i said and what it was different last year. 30% of our activities happen outside outside the euro area so this is why the forex impact is a particularly high this year. Because you know that the euro has lost some of its value specially a visa vida dollar. In the france. Organic growth is a satisfactory of course it is lower than at the group level. Because we have a 20% grip at the group level. In france growth was a mainly driven thanks to a civil aeronautics with airbus for example it represents 26% of the. Friendship revenue it has grown by more than 46% and i think that we have a exceeded our. Crisis level. The growth has always been driven by a nuclear activities in france and energy activities overall and represent approximately 10% of the revenue with a comprehensive growth of approximately 20% and the automotive industry which represents 10% of the year french revenue has only grown by 6% and. The grove is the mainly a due to. Protractor executed on offshore and mini for. Oem. So we have not yet recovered the apricot levels. And the projects. Increasingly. And rely on me and detroit. Internationally. Like in france you can see that the organic growth is robust. I took 23% represents the 2/3 of the overall growth and we will see later on that the organic grow. Is a strong and almost all geographical areas where we operate. All right. So here you can see the various geographical areas. And. The details. For the majority of them at least and the developments for the first half of. You can see that the overall the average growth is around the 20% with two exceptions is scandinavia. In scandinavia activities the concentrate on. Heavy tracks. And. Bouncing back was more difficult in this region and second was a switzerland which represents a very small show of our revenue. We can see you that in other regency a situation it is a positive in the iberic region. And he had a group has reached to 23.5% in germany. Activities. Had to start picking up but in the in the last semester the last half of the second half of the year last year. With a total growth of 23.5% that this is have been unprecedented for the past 10 years and italy. I'm sorry i beg coupons and we have seen a strong growth in the automotive industry in germany. With the. Plus 35% growth and it represents a picture of the german revenue and it has a recovery different. Prices. In italy. And 27% in growth and this has been the case of for several years consecutively. In ben alex and the growth is a picking up again as we had seen at the end of 2021 has reached a 17% at the end of june 2022 mainly driven by the netherlands. Where activities are increasing india semiconductor and electronic components. In belgium and growth that is above a 5% but you can see that the. Is the lower compared to other countries in the region. In the uk the activity is doing a very well as well with a plus 25% to growth. And we have seen the significant growth in the aeronautic activity in sector and the. Sector as well with a 100% and 40% growth respectively. In eastern europe is a sustained as well with an approximately 40%. Minecraft thanks to a poland which has a driven this growth with a + 50% growth and romania + 20% growth thanks to the also and automotive and the energy sector now north america which includes the us and canada the united states represents approximately 80% of the area. We have recorded a + 25% growth in the us and plus 30% grow. In canada thanks to services and aer. Now asia pacific. This region has been the growing steadil. It represents it today. A significant set of the groups activities. Be a pace of growth has accelerated in the. A second quarter. Weather an average of more than 40%. China represents a big third of the area and has grown by 25%. India represents 30% of the region and that has the recorded a 40% growth and japan represents 10% of the region a. And then i has grown by 10% and singapore we are mentioned this country seldom the only but actually this country has recorded a + 60% grow. When i talk about china and india are of course mentioned local activities because activities carried out in china and india. The delivery is centers the activities carried out in the delivery centuries are not. Taking into account locally because they involved the. Foreign markets for example the us. No. The income statement. You can see that we're emerging has the increased. The operating profit has increased by a 52%. I'm going to give you the main components so as you can see the margin has increased by 40%. 40 bibs. But it was a significant increase. Of our activity levels associ. This represented 140 bits. We had to face as it was expected a worsening of. The. Racial income wages unfortunately dna's had the decreased by 15 bits. We decided to start investing in the commercial and hr structures this has been the case since the end of 2021. We will have a closer look at this in the second half of the year the results of the second. So you can see that the overall the situation is a satisfactory and much better than what we had anticipated. Free cherries that have achieved the 15.4 million euros this. A. It should increase next year as well. Prius sure is. Have the increased. When you look at the total amount. We have also seen as strong increase of the value of a free assurance because of the changes on the stock market sim. We have a 6.2 million euro results as well. This includes our various acquisitions. And pasta musicians of with the 6.5 million euros and the restructuring cost of the 0.8. We have also won some illegal proceedings against the other side which has a reimburse. 1.5 million in euros in. Yes after has reached 48.2 million euros. So this is something that will have to be taken into account it should be lower in the second half of the year. How many financial income analysis. Bfrs 16 is for accounting purposes of course. Yeah you can see that we are in the positive bracket with the 1.8 million euros and. Is. Financing its activity is a through a structured banking activities and through its own. Capital. So we have reached the balance when you look at the cost of net financial. But you can see at the figures on the on the screen and the other net financial income represent no point of 4%. Here let us look at the income statement by a region you can see some significant differences between france and in the and the overseas of course. In france. When we have seen those summer increase and some improvements in the figures and. Something pizza. The operating margin grew by 14 boobs thanks to an increase of the contracts for france or activity level that has picked up very strongly because the activity level of the q1 of 2021 was still penalized by the aerospace activity and business so the increase of the activity level is generated 10 beeps from the gross margin. And so we had to take into account the wage ratio. In france the 16 ratio of the as progressed by. 10. And jenny's the rate that remains stable i wanted to say that france because of the majority of the country and its organization and it's critical size is integrated in his p&l a number of overhead corporate court that we will call corporate cost that will be broken down over the whole group. And that are because of the positioning of france and the group activities be supported by the french business so if we need to think in economical terms the operating result of france would be around 10% and the international body just slightly below. The new effects on the credits for taxes it's about the same then last year. At about 7 to 8 million euros for the first half of the year internationally and operating margin that it keeps growing. For the same reasons and that goes from 11.5 to 13 in 2022 gross margin that progressed by 16 peeps because of an improvement of the productivity an activity level that grew as well. In a little less because it was higher internationally in the first semester of 2021 which explains an increase of 120 beeps. So. Sg&e that is the diminishing as well by 20 beeps in the first to half. So a results that goes over the 13% in the internationally by geographic areas without getting into too many details but to give you the major trends we have north america that sees its margin with a double digit growth germany a very high activity rate. And that's has a debit of about 5% for the first half of the year it hadn't happened in wild scandinavia that maintains inventibility structure between 7 and 9. Uk better looks thousand europe i've improved they rented the profitability that was already way above 10% and asia pacific has improved this profitability that is over 10% now. The balance sheet of elton a very healthy structure no major comment on that the analysis of our. Hey over figures are with the same you can see. The consequence of the policies of m&a policy or equity are getting stronger consistently that represent 40% of. The total of the balance sheets. 156 million to the liabilities of elton at the end of june 117 that are to be repaid within a year and the rest 30 million in less than a year the net cash has shrunk for the reasons that i will explain to you in the next slide. And this was a gearing was the adminus 5 is now at -4.1 at the end of june. A small parentheses the influence of the eye for a 16 on the p&l. And the balance sheets. The impact is the nil. On the accounts none on the income statements. And the financing statement of course the irs says 16 are majorly. Real estate because that represents 85% of that line. A quick analysis of a free cash flow and alton's cash on this first half of the year. Antennas generated at the 1st to semester of 2022. A cash flow. Outside of the eiffel 16 of. 113 million years which is operational cash flow that represents 11.7 of the revenue and that is aligned with our operating result which is 11.4. This cash has helped pay for taxes for 43%. For sorry for 46.4. Take more higher than i thought. So the cash out says become normative again which is not the case before. For a reason suffer decreasing revenue. It's the lines with the tax burden that is in the p&l. It also financed the evolution of the bff the wcr. With capex at 0. Percent of the revenue so our free cash flow is slightly positive and it is at 1.1 million years. The financial investments represents 116 million years among which 107 link to the m&a strategy acquisitions. And or not the the rest is a cautioning to the company's associated company the dividend that went from you one year to one year 30. Has explained the outflow of. 44 million euros and logically the forex effects on cash flow. For the subsidiaries in the foreign currencies as generated a revelation of the cash flows in currencies this is what you see. What kohl's other financial flows for 1.6 million years so at the end of june the cash flow was positive. For with a number of 62.4 million euros net cash. Considering regarding the wcr you're going to have questions on that so i'm going to try to anticipate your questions on that one we have a growth of the wcr that is quite significant. It is linked on the one hand to an organic growth that is very sustained. At the second semester of 2021 of the first semester of 2022 who have an organic growth of. And a 20% and at the end of june. It's the time when the cash flow is at the slowest point and where the key accounts are at the lowest point. So if we want to explain the solution of wcr you haven't already growth that generated a grow. Of 102 million for accounts receivable. And the pickup of activities at the clients with the clients and the negotiations on rates that lasted longer than usual. Have led to receive their pills late and so the invoiced late the activity of the first semester. Which. Post pushed back the invoicing and. And also increase the receivables so i guess so ray rose because when back to its. Cool video level which is 94 days so. Increased since december 21 2021 it should go down by the end of the year i cannot tell you exactly what number it is going to be at because a lot of clients ask us to push back the invoicing for a few days. To improve their presentations their financial presentations but it may not get back to the 86 day points. But i hope we'll try at least to bring it down to 90 or danny wine. Symmetrically this increase of the day so has led to an increase of the accounts of receivable by 96.5 million and forex effect of 100 million euros. Considering the growth of the liabilities have increased by 44 million years. On the slide we're not going to stay on it very long i want to present that to you because because of the seasonality of the activity is very important to look at the evolution. Of our free cash flow. Rolling 12 months. So just a few conclusions here. Of course the cash flow. Is systematically aligned with the operating income the seasonality is you can read it through the variations of the changes in wcr which is more clear over 12 months and 6 months the organic growth of course is you can. Is everywhere in the numbers because. It has a clear impact on the clients. Point. And the catholics are very low because they're between 0.620.8 of the revenue. Don't like to like. Basis. With an array of about 10% of free cash flow is around 6 to 7% of the revenue. So you have here. The information that i gave to you. A constantia show dear so sorry are free cash flow would have been at 100 million years. So to sum up. What do you need to retain from these figures from the first half of the year alton has largely exceeded its pre-crisis activity level thanks to a very sustained organic growth since q2 2021. Taking acquisitions into account business has grown by over 30% in 2 years. So very significant growth. The operating margin reaches 11.4% thanks to an improvement of the gross margin margin sorry based on a high activity rates. Productivity that is enhanced on projects despite an adverse price salaries effect and a relative decrease of the stna. So a very strong organic growth we start investing on structural projects. And reinforcing of course the teams for recruitments hr and sales teams. The organic grows and seasonal effects have hindered free cash for this semester however we sell financed the all our activity whether it's organic activity. M&a's. Financing the dividends that increased and so we end with the positive cash position of 62 million euros gearing is at -4.1%. So a very healthy structure that will help us carry out the. Acquisition policy in the next semester. So the operating margin is at 11.4% because of difference between working days between s1 and as they are less favorable we only have two days so over the years we'll have probably one more day. Practically two maybe versus last year. So people you know took a lot of time off over more. Over the second semester than the first semester so the activity level is about the same so the gross margins should grow should drop and the structuration effects. Effort sorry. Helped us to pick up the. Gna rates. So we'll have. A s2 margin that will be lower than the s1 margin. And i will leave us with an operating margin for activity that is very satisfying i'm now going to give the floor to seymour. Who will commence to you the development strategy. The girls strategy. Thank you bruno. So to conclude this presentation and answer your questions. Very quickly everything has been said no worries no concerns on the business for the years to come. We. Are looking at a market where demand is higher than the offer we have. Deficits of engineers and we have to adjust to that. And then when quality recruiting and to attract talents. To fill up those needs. Regardless of the economic situation and despite their major crisis that. Mentioned early on we always managed to get through them. In 2020 we. We thought that this house crisis that was quite spectacular. Would be different from the other crisis. And we haven't taken advantage enough of the situation to recruit heavily because we if we had a crystal ball or when we're sitting at home with our masks on we made the mistake of not anticipating that. And then. 2003 we recruited massively. And that gave us a formidable. Advance on our. Company competitors there was only a few of us in 2003. 15. 6,000 engineers and we recruited everly as well in july of 2009 despite what was going on this time this crisis this covid crisis we didn't do it and we can only regret it and we have to draw the lessons for the future will always be. Facing a loss. Deficit of engineers. And we'll have. To valorize our offers and our market is our limits so regarding. The challenges for the future we have to keep our margins of course with the pressure on the wages. Went a little better than the plan 70% of the clients agreed 30% are keeping their pressure on or trying to push us to delocalize which is not a good thing so we have to generate enough managers and directors to conquer the critical sizing old countries. And the new sectors that are not yet existing or not yet deployed. In many countries. So that's the challenges with the cross-cutting structures that are going to cost money manager sales managers or team of 50 people. That will have to improve the technical management international coordination tenders management all these new things are going to cost money but they're going to add added value and they're going to help us keep our margins. Third point. What is the the competitors doing we might have a trump to play. Which will bring to elton the different view from the clients they like. Just to be. That alton. We have to deliver in some areas. Where are competitors don't have the advantages that we have are offshore capacity we have to double it. And we work a lot on it right now. We are quite satisfied we need to congratulate ourself because in 2019 we had announced for 2022 a goal of 44,000 engineers. Despite the year 2020 and the first semester of 2021 that were major crisis were quite scared we went above this goal. Through the ebony's but all sorts of organic growth because of where now today at over 46,000 engineers. And if the m&a is allowed we'll get to 50,000 so despite covid we went over the goal that we set for ourselves. And for the next years of course if we manage our transnational organization and. The production of managers. Because we're actors and leaders in our very specific positioning so we need to produce these the resources will go above the $70,000 engineers mark. That's for our strategy a new major surprises it's quite simple we need to be up to our size and our goals and challenges i think you. For your attention and bruno and myself. Are here to answer the questions that you may have. St charles hospital. Hello my name is tomorrow i have a few question can we have the staff turnover for the first to have the year. In a slide you said that the operating result was much a broader in technical assistant than what package is it due to some sort of volatility volatility is there an ocean of productivity that can actually impact this margin. And. What about the rising interest rates isn't it. Impacting downwards and our activities in some sectors and maybe it's too early on to say. But regarding the staff to know very of course it has a increased. Because they usually. On average over the past 20 years it was around the 25% so this means that you're usually engineers stay for 4 to 5 years or with us. We are recruits a 50% of a young engineers that we have between 0 to 2 years of experience and the rest have between 2 to 4 years of experience. Well so we try to retain as much as possible and those individuals who can actually manage a team or offer some significant experience but now we have the exceeded 30% but this is not. Homogeneous depending on the years of experience we see a gap between the two groups. So this means that the where is the one group on which we are concentrating we are investing in terms of communication follow up and support and training this is the two to four year experience engineers because theft and over had raised almost 40%. What it was slightly below 25% for the younger engineering. So of course it is some. Stop turning over meant that we. Had to invest more in our recruitment activities. And. It has been marked by a 5% increase. No. Regarding. Idea margin so between the work package and the technical assistance. Dear fees. And that we negotiate when we are in a short list. All right if he's still. Two to three years. Time frame. It is the approximately around $400 per day it's really cheap to be honest with you. It's a. Time is less than what a lawyer would charge. But this is not fag even the level of the training and education and the level of quality of our services but this is our positioning so you understand the pressure that we are under so we are. Constantly negotiating our fees when we renew. Contract. We have. And dumper is away the companies which are currently struggling on the market and which are also trying to decrease to reduce the prices by 5%. To try and win a contract and. So this is a way for them to try and force us to lower our fees of course. Did too many competitors on the market and doing a much better of resisting much better but they concentrate on offshore. Comma jenny's between a 10 to 11. 12% we are first in class of course. We had to. A better margin it would be even better but if you look at local market so we are first in class our resilience is strong. And the fact that some more than 60% of our revenue comes from the work packages means that we don't have to negotiate our fees on a daily basis this is why the margin on their work packages is better because we no longer talk about daily fees. But rather we and negotiate our effieza for a project as a whole. And you know some groups when they are too cheap they can also scare away some of the clients so this is about the margin of the fed question i'll let you answer. Yes of course the interest rate that the increase in interest rates is going to drive prices down of course this is not yet visible but i think it is going to happen. Let's say that the. Is slowing down of the investment funds and build ups or acquisitions in our sector is there something that we have noticed but not in our sector to be honest private equity funds are very much a present in an m&a company this is the case there is a lot of. Competition. There is no exclusive negoti. And. Private equity funds are very much present in our sector that's for sure. But what we can say over the best three worries and the changes in the international environment has impacted the it starts. And some of these are startups had some very good ideas of for sure but they wanted the seed funding something from 1 million euros and the wages and salaries were almost a double. What we can ourselves offer but they were using money which they did not even have and they were asking for it to start an activity so this has changed and this is this means that the playing field is leveling out. Hello. Can i go mommy. I wanted to talk about surprises again and the offshore. We see that the economic situation is a compounding at the moment. However the man the remains a very strong in all sectors and industries that's fine. But if we look at the 2023 let's say that the situation worse since considerably some industries are stuck with some investments that they will have to carry out in the automotive industry for example. Or at the energy sector. Is that going to be any additional pressure on casa for example. This is not something that you are seeing or noticing right now but maybe this could be the case next year and could this lead us actually to concentrate concentrate more on offshore for r&d as well. You are planning to move from 15 to 20% of offshore r&d. Is this link to the situation or. Are you maybe going to have to accelerate your offshore road map if the situation goes in the right direction that i mentioned. Well. All operators we can actually concentrate more on offshore will do so no matter whether or not there is a crisis or not. It is not about the key services or externalizing or outsourcing a complete admin service offshore. This would not be a strategic it is. So it's feasible but in the aeronautics. Industry or in defense industry there are some things that cannot be outsourced into place of. So there are some activities which will have to be protected because of that very nature. But on the automotive industry does not have this kind of constraints. Then look at the stellantis for example. But actually that's not really the case for. Diamond constructors. Because they don't really like her to. And go offshore it down only go as far as the romania or bulgaria for example but it may be the case for other constructories. So european of sharing which concerns the. Engineer is the main increase. 3 to 4. Engineers in the next few years but this is the case for europe. And this is true as long as we remain in our blue pillar so everything about engineering. But the situation is different in the us the shortage of the resources is even more marked than here and they have a lot of front offices in india because they can be the intermediary person between an american companies and their clients and. Unfortunately we are not really present in the us. This is not our main market. We have. I must say. With we mentioned the example of 400 indian engineers working at india for the us so for the us they can be up to they can be offshore for up to 50%. So in the us the situation is different. But it is not a massive change because this is already the situation. And it is different from what happens elsewhere. So we are not worried in this sense so we know what our clients need and we know that we can win more contracts. Hello la honda. I have four questions for you. I know that it's used to still early to talk about the 2023 but earlier you mentioned you said that some sectors were hit harder than others in previous crisis. Have you had any feedback from your clients regarding the potential investments for 2023 or is it too early. And in your opinion. Which already is sector is in which you feel more less confident. Other question. The performance is really good in asia-pacific in all the geographical regional regions of course but can you tell us a bit more in details. What is happening really in asia what about the clients and now that we have some experience in this area and this region do you think that the. This area i can actually generate some significant revenue in 5 to 10 years. Imagine is at 11.4. We are increasingly turning towards the international market but what about the. The margin of we are becoming. Precocious. Is it 11 at the new normal. And then what about the pace of the recruitment for the second half of the year what about q3 what is your ambition. Are you still looking to. Recruit more engineers in the september and through the the third quarter this year. But a lot of questions i'm going to try and do my best to answer all of them. So in 2023. What are our concerns in. That will be some hardships and some sectors. But this is not going to be linked to some specific needs or activities but the. Cultural aspects in these a sectors. Let me take the example again of the automotive industry the automotive industry is constantly under pressure even when everything is going well. And in the automotive industry the pressure is constant. I'm trying to harmonize the activities internationally. And they have no problem going offshore. And because the answer any specific safety aware. Illegal restrictions. So. Even if we increase our head count it doesn't mean that our revenue will increase by so much because when you have a 500 engineers in india morocco or elsewhere. This corresponds to a loss of 200 engineers in france for example and the revenue which will move from one region to the other will be divided by three. But offshore has a higher margin because if we manage this correctly we can have between 15 to 20 points. So. This is what i said if we have offshore salesman points and delivery points as well in asia for example delivery centers in asia we can reach higher margins but the revenue is actually moved from one region to the other is but then we have to do a careful analysis to see what this means completely. So maybe we could reach a 12% if we had a 70,000 engineers including. 20,000 offshore. So i laid out our plan for europe we said that maybe 3 to 4,000 would go offshore but the impact would not be so significant. But this is for europe you know that overseas and it works differently. We're in our presents is limited in the us and in the us is offshoring phenomenon as massive but because of our limited presence this is not going to impact on very much. And regarding your last question. We are. First in class. I'm doing very well our. Not out i worry. Presence is around 10% while a competitories. Fair around the 6:00 to 7% and so we have to make sure that we are nail everything and charge sales representatives capex management of web packages and so on and so forth so this 10% figure is incredible and we could maybe reach 11% of martin if we want a bit more offshore. But i prefer to remain cautious because i do not want to disappoint anyone and i'd rather. Be a realistic. The. Models for a dentist not to to go from 11:00 to 12:00 but rather to reach a 10%. 11% that would be great over the next 10 years. 11% would also mean that the situation is very bright but if there are any unfavorable events for example a deadline or a problem hitting a sector maybe we could go down to 9% so we would be very happy with 10 10.5%. And this is what we. Are doing this year we have reached a 10 10.5% so we are very happy about this and we will make no promises about reaching 11 to 12% of course. Another sector which could be problematic is that of the services. This is not our main area i just part of the yellow pillar that we mentioned at the beginning it is part of the services a retail banking finance so we know that they are going to be some pressure on the sector so we'll have to make the most of it because we are present in the sector of course but our footprint is very specific because we are an it supplier and not a bpo supplier. Now regarding regarding the specificities of asia and our development in the region. Down three areas in asia so india china. And it's japan korea. India represents half of the local market which still has to be developed. And and the remaining half is the delivery center is for the rest of the world we have more than 7,500 engineers in india as i said and thanks to the local market which represents 50% of our local activities in india. We will reach a 10,000 i think. Tia local market. Like any other local market you have an indian engineers were engineer working. An indian clients and we reached margin of 10% this is true every. And the app store not yet. Oh well that's something to it because it is not really a fully fledged indian market it is a hybrid situation so. I mentioned already our offshore strategy. Regarding china. We have never had any intention to concentrate on china only. We were lucky to find a. Very positive advantages and it acquisition in china which works on the unbox equipment and telecommunications for international players and the clients and not. Only chinese plans of course we decided to acquire this company it has a reinforcement with food our footprint in china with more than 3,000 people in china. We will try to increase our footprint with. 4 to 5,000 employees. Yeah the man is very strong in china but we are always scared of. Something. Happening similar to what is happening in russia or in ukraine there may be a geopolitical crisis in a few years so this is why we are being very careful in china. So our strategic approach is different of course. And. And revenue is an hour a bit that is around 10% like in any other local market. For japan in korea it's a slightly different it's like the us or germany or the uk. We should have at least a 10,000 engineers in japan. Given the importance of the country being a japan and korea. In the germany and the austria we should have 10,000 as well and same in the us so we have three areas. Which should reach critical size. Only in france and india we have reached this month so we need to find the way to do this and to accelerate mma's of course so we need to make the most of organic and external growth. In these areas where the anti potential is immense. Other countries we have a 2 to 3,000 engineers italy spain bennelech the nordics eastern european countries. Canada as well. We are going to get there we are already halfway there. Or even a bit more we could increase by two fold if we do things right. Regarding asia. We are going to have some organic growth in china same in india with the delivery centers and i think that we will do much better with m&a thanks terminates in japan. Recounting. A recruitment for the second half of the year. It should be okay but it is tough. We may not reach the set objective because we are struggling with recruitment and stuff to know them. I had to fantasize i would be able to announce that we have the rich the 50,000 engineering mark but i don't think this will be the case unfortunately. Nicola davita. I have three questions on my side. First one is an organic growth at the time of the teacher q2 sorry figures and organic growth over. 2%. Is it still. We we had a more 12 to 15% for the second semester second the. Prospects on the margins you talked about being over 10 and 1/2. We expected you to be below that i can see that s1 is much better than we expected is it. Above 10.5 can we reach the margin of last year i would love to. To have the elements of the gross margin of s2 my question is on north america. You have a profitability that is just above 10 below 10%. Considering that it's a country with the positive pricing and that does offshore what is the rate of margin that you can expect for companies such as alton if you include offshore and what could be. The weight of this country for you you talked about 10,000 engineers but it's a bigger margin of market than korea or japan on the long run we should be able to go above this number with a mix of offshore what could be the revenue for north america would you. Is it something that you want to grow that you're following up on the long term. I'm going to answer your your second question on the margins of the second semester we have two effects that. Make us be cautious on the s2. Is the calendar effect that it's going to be the favorable unfavorable that's the way it is and we. There's a very big inertia. In the impact. Of the evolution of the average rate versus the increase of prices. So the turnover. Is here the recruitment. Is it since we have a big turnover we have new recruits coming in we have pressure on the wages. And that is impact the statistically the alton population throughout. The rotations of engineers in our headcount so they will be an impact that has not been shown yet in the first and s1 it's been only affecting the newcomers but it's going to be more significant on s2 so we're quite prudent on s2 and. I don't think we do better than 11% on s2. But i'd like to i'd be very happy if we just over 10% if we announce you the good news at the end of the year would be great but i don't expect to do 11% on his two considering these two phenomenon that i just explained. It just to be clear for s2. 10.5. Very likely. But it's not a perfect signs here and regarding. The forecast for organic growth i'm going to let maybe bruno answer you we didn't give any figures in the release on the organic growth of s2. Generally speaking we don't give them a very precisely. There's nothing you under the sun visa communication of july. We said that so we have an organic growth that would be above 10% on s2 this is confirmed you mentioned the number of 12 to 15 it's quite possible. Concerning the strategy on north america. North america and it's the united states because canada is a bit different and mexico is as well but the united states working very different way than we do. They are culturally. For the last 20 years have shortage of engineers. And they turned for reasons of shortage. And not only for price reasons to offshoring. And so they got used to delocalize externalized strategically. Some entire businesses. The subsidiaries and in india. And who are local customers who act as local customers in the country most industrial structures american structures have their representation in india. And these indian representations become a local indian actors. So to tackle the. The american market and tell say that we want to have 10,000 people it's not. Dealt the same way then in europe so it's a bit of a riddle for us we have to. We're going to buy companies 500,000 people. Who are already companies with engineers that are in india who deliver projects with front sale unique front sales in america. And those are not structures. That recruits. Engineers in the us to conduct projects in the us except it for the defense sector they're not going to let us work in the defense sector in the us being french you imagine that. So if you want to conquer a local market we may have a chance to have something in rail energy. Aerotics with boeing maybe. But we're not present there at all today so we have hopes to ramp up there. If we could export the french management. To dallas or seattle that would be great but we don't have people that mobile and they don't really want to go to the us so. So we're not going to find the american manager's either there's a lot of many many little companies in the us but no major play no major structure. So that's. Comes in the way of us. Conquering. The local to local markets. And for the market and to us if we have 10 india to us if we have. 10,000 people. We'll have maybe through four in the us and the rest in india so these two equations. Are quite complicated. For us to solve. We may be good at what we're doing but so we're not geniuses and we have to find a way to export some managers to the us it may be easier to develop a strangely enough for japan than to develop the us in terms of margin. The local to local. There's there's always been settling at about 10 points of a bit and for the offshore. 10 to 15 for the a bit for the offshore so that's the general outlook of what would be a business of 10,000 people we have competitors who bought some freelance companies you could see what it's boiled down to it is not at all our strategy. So we're going to take some questions from internet for questions from. Derek my call from the sg. The first question is what is the weight of manufacturing injuring in a percentage of the revenue for s1 2022 you mentioned 4% for s1 2021 do you see any signs of slow down in the automotive sector or other manufacturing sectors. Third question could you give us some indication on the level of net staff. Add the dates of the q3 2022 and you think that this level to q4 2020 to be as strong as. For q3. Last question for derek marco in what way do you imagine the games of productivity on the projects can be sustained. Regarding the volume of manufacturing you have to be careful about the definition of manufacturing. In the presentation i send you back to the presentation slide 8. We have. 75% of blue activity. Which is engineering that is the design engineering and manufacturing and genuine. And deployment as well and customer support so that's the second branch. You have. The activity. Design and conceive of the plants. Design of the two a plant is a digital project that's the way. And you have a deployment of a projects trains and airports and. Etc. And nuclear plants. Or telecoms hours. And you have customer supports so after the design and prototyping phase you have three activities manufacturing over the 75% weighs about for about. The total of these three activities outside of the design phase. Represents 25 to 30%. Of these 75%. In which the manufacturing represents 20%. With plans 4.0. So sorry. To not to be able to be more precise but it gives you a general perspective and there's some sectors and businesses that we're not going to go into in for example production manufacturing. We're not very present on the supply chain supply chain big bpos of managing. Commissioning that are more up to the accentures and other companies like this. But when they're developing in the it services will go for that. The margin regarding the margin and the productivity of the work packages were quite proud. That we have invested on methods and tools this is a real know-how and expertise. And beyond a child recruitment this is our capacity to secure our clients. In the conditions of delivery. And respect of the specifications of the projects that we being handed. The work packages of the project that we managed to go from 5 to 40 people navigate about 20 people for a year year and a half. So that represent project between two and three millions this is not bpos with 300 people for three six years this is specific. Projects. Everything is new every time. There's nothing that could be reused from a previous project because we're always looking at a new product. So this talent to do something new build up teams we have capitalized on it. For. Work a real-time software. In a very. In a very relevance of matter matter. We classify all the vectors of production productivity improvement you have optimization of resources in terms of talents you have optimization of the occupation rates. You have management. Office is managing equipment flex office. Offshoring. The potential that i'm showing represents for certain projects even if sometimes the client doesn't even ask for it. Training of technical directors and managers. All these eight elements it's not a matter of are we good or not on it we've put in place a whole process the quality process and optimization. Of delivery. And techniques on our work packages. We have. Obtain some major improvements in most areas must have a bit more to get to get. But we've gained a lot already we can maybe gain one point on the work packages if we improve everything that can be improved but we're already in a good place. And we're probably one of the best companies in the world in this capacity. Of reelability of delivery of the work packages sometimes much better than all kinds so that's for the gain of productivity and technical assistance it's just about to negotiations of rates with our clients and they're always very difficult. Question for you a bruno there's one on the slowdown of the automotive industry they're not there's not one at the moment the industry is growing there are no signs that i'm aware of. Office slow down it remains quite dynamic regarding the eric's question of direct staff hiring on q3 and q4 will give you an answer in october once we publish the activity of q3. Another question from mcdonald's. Could you give us an update on the percentage of client who accepted price rise rises this year i gave you a ratio 70% of the clients accepted the new prices. We've had. Clients who accepted a raise of for five to six percent some accepted one to two percent. So that gives you an average of the raises that we had. It's not linked to a sector. It's linked to the personality of the team of the procurement team of the climate of the client sorry and the pressure that the technical or hr managers put. On procurements. And how the procurement teams is being incense incentivized tyvised. Knowing that. If you are in the work package mode. The kind negotiations are not so fundamental it's just. Being put in competition on a project of 2030 people between three or four companies that have been selected. And then depending on the technical quality of the answer that you provide you at 5% then the client will take you or will not take you. So it's not really a negotiation of rates it's more like a real competition if you have a dumper in front of you who's on the market. Who wants to get into the market and it's prepared to do -10 or -20%, we had this case. Some we we have people who did that and they entered at a loss. So it's more linked to. Sales the negotiation. Then real afiza negotiation if we're the technical assistance in 30%. There's some cost that we cannot cut so sorry some kinds we will not budge. This is we don't want any increase in the fees. And they take the risk either to have a lower quality of have less offers. That we could make them the automotive sector is always tough but the other sectors it depends on everybody's approach. A question on. The recruitment topic can you. Explain to us what is elton doing to reinforce recruitment and how do you retain talents. How do you differentiate yourself from other players. That you're up against i don't know if we're that different. From other companies. We have increased by 30 to 40%. The means what called dsi. It's the management of for the engineers we want them to be heard more. Listen to more because of this fear of turnover that we had at the beginning of the year we want to know if they're satisfied with their projects if they're satisfied with their compensation. And also. If they're satisfied with the managers. And a career perspectives so we need to see them more often we need to listen to them more often. To provide to ola consultants engineers possibilities to grow in their career and to remind them of it. It worked. Of course racing the. The wages was the fundamental elements and we could retain a lot of people who. Getting a higher pay. Ohio paycheck so. We're just trying to do our job. There were some questions on the margin but i think a bruno you answer that a question on. The economic situation in case we enter a recession what do you think what will be the economic sectors that will be the most resilient and what will the growth and the margins of elton look like. I would be surprised that we have. A recession on. Transports. I want to text or land transports what happened in 2020 was linked to a. The covid crisis. That's. Locked to everybody down unless we go back to such a scenario. The sector should not. Have any issue and they're actually in quite high demand. Including the automated automotive sector. The sectors that we fear could be creating a problems is retail and finance banking because they have to change all their tools. If there's maybe a slight concern it would be more than that direction a series of three questions on the level of demand can you tell us about where you can expect in terms of demand in your conversations with your clients. Our clients thinking about pushing back. Caring for their expense on r&d or. How are the conversations on prices with your clients how they evolved. Over the two semesters of 2022 and in 2023. And last question is it possible to reduce even further the overhead. On the middle term. To compensate the increase of. Employees increase the staffing increase. So regarding prices will have less pressure on the negotiations on fees. To renew the referencing. It's done three times a year every 3 years. That should be going fine. Except again for those who want dutch but we're not worried about that. The only vector of economy that our clients have is the offshore. And they're limited enough showing because of the strategic part of it. Because of all the works we do for them on their core business i gave you the numbers early on and the forecast so. It remains in a bracket of volume that is quite well defined. Regarding the demand we have no warning signs today at the present moments despite everything we hear on the current environments. Maybe because we have a small presence footprint in the us. Is hiding from us things are going to be coming to europe next year. But we still do go to the us and we. And we don't we it's difficult to hire there as well to find people there. A series that that's those are going to be the last questions. And then we'll end with a question in the room. Can you comment on the impact. Of the prices and the wage. For the first semester and for the second for the growth of s2 can you comment on the strongest sectors and the weakest sectors. And what does it. Mean in terms of. Growth rates in general can you comment on the contractual negotiations. And the impact that you could have that you could have on your calendar. And the wcr. I think we've answered to those questions so the impact of the balance between prices and wages it's evaluated at 50 beeps at s1 it's of course they're going out going through the year the prices are negotiated once a year and they really change throughout the year even if it happens. We had anticipated an evolution of the ratio wage and the prices that was 70 to 80 beeps. For the year 2022. Which means that it will have a biggest impact on during s2 than. Bigger than this one the second question that was asking if you could just read it out for me again sorry. The last question was. On the contraction contract negotiations can you comment them. For the and it's impact on prices and how it could affect. Your calendar and your wcr. So the negotiations already started for i've already happened for 2022 will start the negotiations for 2023 at the end of the year at the beginning of next year so we'll have no impact on s2 nor on the wcr nor on the margins. We may see some increases of rates that could be for clients so where are the referencing is less structured but for our major counts. We have references that are annually so we'll talk about next year. Another question from no more question online. If somebody has a question in the room. Please. Speak up otherwise she was really you can wrap up this presentation. So i hope that between the presentation and the questions we could address. Most. Of the questions that you were asking yourself we remain very optimistic despite an environment that is challenging. But one because where we did on the works packages mode by the 2:30 by 2/3 and second because we are looking at a market of shortages which is quite unique. And offer is. So big smaller than demand so thank you very much for your attention and your questions.
