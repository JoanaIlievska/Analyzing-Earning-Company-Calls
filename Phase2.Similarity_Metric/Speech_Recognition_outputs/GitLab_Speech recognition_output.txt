I will now turn the call over to get labs co-founder and chief executive officer brand. Thank you for joining us for our fiscal year 2023 2nd quarter earnings presentation. We continue to see strong momentum in our business. And we believe that our second quarter results indicate that the market is embracing our devops platform leadership position. We also executed well in the quarter. Demonstrating our ability. To achieve high growth with increasing operating leverage. In the second quarter of fiscal. 2023. We exceeded our guidance with revenue of 101 million. This represents revenue growth. 74% year over year. Our dollar based net retention rate exceeded our own reporting threshold of 130%. This remains best in class and consistent with our track record as a public company. Our second quarter results also continue to demonstrate the attractive unit economics underlying our business. Are none. Operating margin improved by. 1500 basis points year over here. And we remain committed to growing in a responsible manner. Every company needs to be great at developing securing and operating software. Or they will be disrupted. This core capability what's called devops is a must-have. Any macroeconomic environment. Enterprises are navigating economic uncertainty. Well still needing to embrace the imperatives of digital transformation. Cloud migration. And app modernization. Our customers choose get laptop to accomplish more. With the people that they already have. Delivering software fast and efficiently in a secure way is essential for success. Are one devops platform empowers them to do exactly that. With one data model and a single interface we create a more efficient and captivating user experience. With gitlab everything from planning building securing deploying and monitoring software. All resides in a single application. This mission critical software helps companies eliminate the costly integration work you have when using point solutions. And it also allows them to create and release software faster. While strengthening software security and compliance. This combination drives business and technology trans. There are three main topics that i will cover today. First i will explain how we enable old types of customers to realize the promise of devops by moving to a platform. Second i will discuss how we are leading the industry in product innovation. And highlight the recent enhancement. From our major get lot 15 launch. Period i will share our view of gitlabs value proposition and how we are well positioned to succeed. Our differentiation starts with our core value of iteration. Which in turn drives are rapid pace of innovation. Get libraries far ahead. In the comprehensiveness of its devops. Every month on the 22nd we ship in new version of gitl. Many new features and improvements. We've done this for 130 months in a row. Our innovation is also driven by the open coordinator of gitlab. Which means that our customers and users. Contribute to the capabilities of the platform. Enabling us to drive even more differentiation and value for all of our customers. Every quarter hundreds of improvements are contributed by our. Are differentiation also extends to security and compliance. In today's environment security is a business imperative. We believe we have the most comprehensive security offering in the market. Enabling companies to truly adopt defect of practices. With getting. Security is integrated throughout the software development and deployment process. Our capabilities include dynamic and static testing. Vulnerability management dependency and container scanning. And coverage guided first. Which enables customers to find vulnerabilities that other qa processes cannot find. Organizations shouldn't have to trade off compliance requirements with their speed of innovation. Developers should be able to easily verify the compliance of their. Without having to leave their workflow. And get lab visibility to perform compliance is automated and resides within the platform. This removes the need for compliance managers to require developers to contact switch among different point solutions. Losing productivity and efficiency in the process. We believe the future of compliance or christ automation. When you create software today you don't write all of the code yourself. Instead you have a supply chain of external dependencies like open source libraries. Did a bundle into a modern software development. However a problem arises with so many dependencies there's no way to accurately and efficiently check all of it manually for security vulnerabilities. This can have devastating effect. When failing to identify security threat. Rollback vulnerable coat and fix and be deployed at coat. This manual process can translate into significant financial and brand damages. Given the existing fat landscape. The only effective pathway forward is to automate that process making the cycle time from identifying a vulnerability rolling back coat and redeploying it. Shorter and shorter. Get lab makes that level of automation seamless for our customers. We have the most advanced offering in the market as validated by customers like hacker one and deutsche telecom. They use our comprehensive capabilities to secure their software supply chain. And make their security and compliance checks more efficient. Are differentiated value to customers is that this security is integrated into our product. Not bolted on as an afterthought. Get labs comprehensive security offering. With so many features. Allows customers to consolidate their spend. They no longer have to integrate with so many other security vendors. More importantly they can create more secure software by shifting security practices earlier in the development process. Perform. Threat and vulnerability analysis as developers create the code. Not after they deployed it. Earlier you integrate security the easier it is to address potential concerns. So you become more productive. And you can afford it for every project and every change. Furthermore because all of the security checks are happening on the same platform. Customers can prove that they perform all of the security checks for that code. With it do it yourself or diy devops approach that requires stringing together. Desperate point solutions. A similar endeavor would require much more personnel and resources. Next i would like to discuss the new advancements in gitlab 15 our latest major release. We focused on three main areas of innovation across the devops life cycle. The first area of innovation is enterprise agile planning. When we talk to customers a primary pain point we hear. Is that existing point solutions lead to a poor user experience. Well they may meet the needs of the individual. The full short of addressing the needs of the broader organization. As an internet platform. Get life is uniquely positioned to integrate planning with execution in a seamless matter. We enable business leaders to drive their vision what empowering devops teams to deliver value more effectively and efficiently. Improving how they collaborate. The second area of innovation is continuous security and compliance. Our customers are looking to solve the pain point of a fragmented security experience which slows down development cycle. It creates more. You don't want to make a full straight off between speed and security they want security and compliance to be embedded and to end. Across the software development life cycle without sacrificing speed. And get like 15 we've introduced new capabilities around software supply chain security. Advanced security scanning. Streamed audit events and more comprehensive governance. The third area of innovation involves are use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This area is particularly exciting because it makes our product better. And it enables us to broaden the appeal of our platform to even more use cases and personas. To illustrate how we are leveraging ai to improve the product. We now have a feature we're gitlab will suggest to developers who should review their. They can find an expert who can provide better feedback. Which creates more efficiency. Swell is higher quality more secure. To invite more personas to the platform like data scientists. We are also integrating the devops process with the mlops process. We see this as the next big step. In consolidating historically separate development workflows. Today machine learning is an essential part of modern application development. Every significant application is going to have both code and models. Dose models go through a life cycle themselves. Which includes training testing and deploying. Data scientists. And engineers are critical stakeholders in its process. Get traditionally they have been excluded from the collaboration and efficiency benefits of devops and automation. Relying on either manual processes or bespoke tool chain that they need to maintain. The benefits of our platform will help data scientists and engineers in the number of ways. From collaboration with other teams. Planning and managing project strength. Version control for automated workflows. Streamline testing and validation. And simplified infrastructure management across multiple cloud providers. We are excited about the significant amount of innovation on our platform. From enterprise agile planning to security to compliance to ai and machine learning. Finally i would like to address why our one devil's platform value proposition is mission critical and resonating with customers in the market. From speaking with customers and prospect. We've assessed that companies are looking to. Five main outcomes from their devopsychee budget. They want to consolidate their software. I don't want to spend money in engineering time integrating tools. They would like to get more productivity in the current people they already hire. It would like the devil's process to better enable their entire organization to deliver value to their customers faster. And they would like to generate more revenue by releasing. Customer facing applications faster. Get lab provides to solution to achieve all of these out. R1 devil's platform. Helps companies reduce costs by consolidating from many vendors down to one. It frees up people from integration work. And in addition moving to a platform allows for clothes to collaboration between development security and operations teams. Fewer contact switches. Which increases productivity and user satisfaction. What get lab delivers is a faster cycle time faster execution on cost saving initiatives. The opportunity for revenue acceleration. To quantify these benefits based on a study conducted by forest or consulting and commissioned by. Our customer saw a 407% return on investment within three years. Of deployment of our devil's plat. Having a comprehensive platform that's all so many problems while at the same time saving money is a superpower. In economically challenging. Is value proposition translated into a number of strong business highlights in a second quarter. I'm proud to share that we add. $69. Net new bass custom. Let me give you an example of a new logo win and up here and a customer expansion. First. And north american base global leader in cross-bord appear to peer payments needed the devil's platform that streamline and automated processes. Reduce cycle time. And provided the ability to set in a force organizational policy across every stage of their development process. From a gitlab proof of value engagement they realized that 30% efficiency improvement in building securing and deploying. Versus the previous tool chain implementation. For both new and changing applications. As a result they became a gitlab sass ultimate customer replacing a previous vendor's implementation. Second north american consumer research data and analytics firm. Who has been a get life starter customer since 2015. Marched multiple business unit. Which had completely silo devops to. A new corporate initiative to move to the cloud catalyzed the need to quickly consolidate onto a single platform. To standardize their entire devops life cycle to increase operational efficiencies. Decreased cycle time and increase developer productivity. By migrating to get lab they immediately saw a 3x increase in productivity. Due to less maintenance time and fewer costs. But it fully integrated gitlab scmci and subsequently upgraded to premium. And finally the north american. Motor vehicle manufacturing company was looking for an alternative to their existing devops products. Because their workloads far exceeded the scaling capabilities of those tools. After working closely with gitlab we demonstrated our unique ability to scale to meet their volume needs for ulster enabling them to consolidate their to. As a result of customer expanded in the second quarter. Increasing their number of premium licenses by 40%. Another key strength of our go-to-market value proposition is our relationship with cloud hyperscal. Bayview get loud as an excellence for customers to move to the cloud faster. Also please with the number of higher level strategic conversations that are happening at the sea level addressing how gitlab can help them solve their business problems. In fact in q2 we were named as. Google cloud partner of the year for application development. Following up from last year and get by bus awarded google cloud partner of the year for devops. Powerful example of the result. From these alliances is key. One of north america's largest financial services companies. Key bank recently formed a partnership. With google cloud platform or tcp. To move workloads from data centers to google cloud. In addition to that cloud migration effort. App development and modernization are key parts of their digital transformation goals. There and please embrace a continuous integration and continuous deployment software development model which the industry called cicd. They choose get lab to bring together their devil's process. Making an initial purchase. Of several hundred ultimate licenses. We see this type of close alignment without a cloud providers including aws. The second quarter gitlab and aws work together to help a major airline manufacturing significantly reduc. The risk of laws in downtime that was required for their business critical development needs. Get lapis now critical to this customers developer team success. They have now standardized us across thousands of users and crossed the million dollar threshold as a customer. These customer success stories in combination with the growth. Of our alliances and partnerships. Clearly showed that the market is moving towards a platform approach to devops. You recently published are 6th annual state of deaf-secopes report. I'll landmark research study of over 5,000 devil's professionals from around the world. Among the many findings we see a continued need for two consolidation 85% of devops team. Use between two and 10 tools. And with 69% of survey participants saying they'd like to consolidate their tool. The need for def secaucus platform is clear. Answer me i'm very pleased with the quarter we continue to innovate and create new capabilities for an expanded set of customers. We continue to demonstrate the promise of a platform overpoint solution approach. And we continue to show to get like this mission critical. And we continue to believe that we are early in a large and growing market. Rq2 results demonstrate that will well position. To drive durable grow. With improving unit economics. I'm grateful to all our team members partners. The white it get life community and customers. Contributed to our results. I also want to thank eric. Rcto. He has resigned effective october 1st and will stay on as an advisor for 6 months. Eric has been with gitlab since 2017. I want to thank eric for our partnership over the last 5 years. I wish him the best of luck. No now turn the call over to brian. Get lots chief financial officer. Thank you sid and thank you again to everyone joining us today. I'd like to spend a moment reviewing the key characteristics of our business model and what we're seeing in the macro environment. Then i will quickly recap our second quarter financial results and key operating metrics. And conclude with our guidance. Our platform delivers a strong roi and positive business outcomes. Customers continually tell us. That they strongly support our pricing model. Our platform is offered with a free version and two page subscription tiers. Which we call premium and ultim. Are pay tears are priced per user with different features per tier. Every user within it organization is on the same plan which helps to keep our business model transparent and easy to understand. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive. Hi gross with improving incremental margin. Feeling these results are a number of key aspects of our business model that i would like to discuss briefly. These include. The predictability of a subscription model that provides high visibility. A platform sale rather than a point solution sale. Diversified customer base. Across industry verticals customer sizes and geographic regions. A short implementation cycle and an establish a well-documented roi. In addition we practice our platform in us dollars. So we have new currency impact. These attributes contribute to the results we are seeing. To illustrate this customer cohorts from 7 years ago are still expanding today. Despite the volatility in the macroeconomic environment in the second quarter. We've not seen any impact our business. Customers increasingly recognized the need to address multi-year digital. Transformation challenges. The current environment is not slowing down customer decisions. Nor elongating our cell cycles. Buying cycles have actually sped up across the business and we continue to see strong wind rates. We're also happy with how we execute on hired. We added a similarly strong number of new team members as we didn't want you. And we experienced lower attrition. We view the uncertainty in the macro economy is a benefit for hiring new team members. And we currently have over $225 open positions that were actively looking to fill. Next turn into the numbers. Revenue of 101 million this quarter represents an increase 74% organically from the prior year. We added the largest number of base customers ever in a single quarter. We ended too cute with over 5,800 customers with ar of at least $5,000. Compared over $5,100 customers in the prior quarter and over 3,600 customers in the prior year. This represents a year every year growth rate of approximately 61%. Currently customers with greater than $5,000 in ar represent approximately 95% of our total arr. We also measure the performance and growth of our larger customers who we define as those spending more than $100,000 in arr with us. At the end of the second quarter of fy 2023. We had 593 customers with arr of at least $100,000. Compared to 545 customers in the prior quarter. And 383 customers in the second quarter of fy 2022. This represents a year growth rate of approximately 55%. As many you know we do not believe calculate billings be good indicator of our business. Given that prior period comparisons can be impacted by a number of factors. Most notably our history of large prepaid multi-year deals. This quarter total rp over 76% year every year to $362 million. We ended the second quarter with a dollar base net retention rate consistent with the previous quarter. This exceeded our reporting threshold of 130% which remains best in class. Inconsistent with our track record as a public company. The ultimate tier continues to be our fastest growing tier. Representing 39% of error for the second quarter of fy 2023. Compared with 29% of arr and the second quarter of fy22. And continue to grow in excess of 100%. Non-gap roast margins were 89% for the quarter which comparison 90% in the immediate proceeding quarter. And 88% for the second quarter of fy 2022. As we move forward we are estimating a moderate reduction in this metric due to the rapid year over your growth rate of our size offering. We saw improve operating leverage across a business's quarter. Largely driven by revenue outperformance. Non-gap operating loss was 27 million or 27% of revenue. Compared to a loss of 24.8 million or 42% of revenue in q2 of fy 2022. Tutu fy2023 includes 5 million of expenses related to our jv and majority and subsidiary. Wayne kurted 2.3 million dollar cancellation fee in q2 as a result of our decision to postpone contribute. Our annual get lab team event. Operating cash use was 36.3 million dollars in second quarter of fy 2023 compared to 17.1 million use in the same quarter last year. In summary we're pleased with our operating performance during the second quarter of fy 2023 on both the top and bottom line and believe our business is set up for continued strength. We continue to see rapid growth while improving the underlying unit economics in the business. We monitor the key leading indicator metrics of our business and we are not seeing any softening in these indicators. Now let's turn the guidance. For the third quarter of fy 2023 we expect total revenue of $105 million to 106 million. Representing growth rate of 57 to 59% every year. We expect a non-gap operating loss of 27.5 million to 26.5 million. And we expect a non-gapment lost per share of 16 cent. The 15 cents assuming $149 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fy2023. We now expect total revenue of $411 million to 414 million. Representative 63%. To 64% year every year. We expected non-gap operating loss of 111.5 million to 108.5 million. And we expect a nine net loss per share of 67 cents. The 64 cents assuming $148 million weighted average shares outstanding. 20 percentage basis are new annual fy 2023 guidance. Implies non-gap operating margin improvement of approximately. 1250 basis points every year with the midpoint of our guidance ranges a few more details on guidance and our model. We now estimate that we will incur approximately 17 million of a criminal expenses related to the resumption of travel and in person. Customer and marketing events as well as new public company costs that were not incurred in the first three quarters of fy 2022. In addition we forecast approximately 20 million of expenses related to who are trying to joint venture. This compares with $12 million dollars of combined jehu and melton cost in fy 2022. I like to know we have deconsolidated melton our majority owned subsidiary. On the finance team front dale brown or principal county officer he shared his intentions of retiring next year. I want to thank dale for all his contributions over the last 3 years. Allowing for a smooth transition. I said mentioned earlier we believe we're addressing a very substantial market opportunity that is currently under penetrated. And that were well positioned to capture are outside portion of it. There has been no philosophical change and how we run the business to maximize shareholder value over the long term. We continue to be focus on grow. While driving improvements in the unit economics are a business. With that will now move to q&. Ask a question please use a chat feature and post your question directly to ir questions. We're ready for the first question. Thank you sit and brian will begin by going to cash at goldman sach. Casually please verbalize your question. I'm sure happy to thank you so much for watching the quarter and great opera minnesota. When you look at the the landscape the competition and we microsoft to spend talking about how it's not just about collaboration with developers to collaboration among office workers is a big trust behind teams you'll see at least in going through a cloud transition they've made collaboration amongst developers and non-developers 18 priority and monday is trying to make inroads into a domain that you have natural focus and concentration. How does this change the comparative landskip because there's more awareness of what you can do for develop productivity in the software development life cycle. And and how does your competitive position. Change or not change and one for you brian as you go through the the to put some takes the of the income statement cash flow etc with the one time joint venture expenses how should we be thinking about the trajectory of. Make your calendar 23 with respect to some of the underlying improvements in operating efficiencies that may not be otherwise apparent thank you so much. Thanks so much cash for those questions. So if you look at gitlam it's not just. For develop. It's for developers security people and operations. And getting them to collaborate well that's the essential part because then you can get from hey we plan to do this. To getting it out there getting it in the hand so if your customers getting feedback. So closing that loop is the most important thing and we have the leading deaf. Bob's platform. In our opinion. And. Really spectacular because think about security it's a really big market. We are replacing vendors like check mark. Favorite coat synopsis. Because we have the whole. We have. Static and dynamic analysis. We have container independency. We have the best processing tools in our opinion in the market. And not only do we have the most comprehensive security offering we're able to link it would really compelling deaf sol. We are expanding into operation so people can do the entire cycle that's the power of one platform. And we believe that is. That really attractive in the in the market. And so we're not in a chattel business or something like that but we do have the most comprehensive desk. In cash out i'll answer the question just around cash flow and so forth. Yeah i'm really happy you're with the business and the fact that we have a radical business so it's got a lot of visibility we're really pleased with the trends that we're seeing. The number one thing that said i have articulated to on the roadshow as well as to the investor basis. Gross is the number one thing that we want to do but we'll do that responsibly. If you look at the second quarter. We delivered 101 million in revenue with a non-gap operating loss of 27 million if you compare that to second quarter of last year. We added 43 million of incremental revenue. At the same operating loss if you extract ju. If you look at our guidance at the midpoint. We're going to we're going to deliver approximately 160 million of additional revenue this year over last year and it improved absolute operating lost and what we did last year you take away jehu and some of the one-time events that we went through. So i'm really happy on the incremental improvements that we've been making and the improving unit economics. Thanks so much. Our next question is from carl at ubs. Call if you're talking you're muted. Charlie when you go to the next one. Next we have matt at rbc. Hey guys thanks for taking my questions congrats on the quarter said i wanted to start with you. You know i'm curious you you in your prepared commercial you called out a cloud or a sass. And i asked you this a couple years ago but i'm curious for an update here do you it is there a network effect that customers see. From increased cloud adoption in a certain do they all benefit from your learn. Of of what's happening with your sas deployment. I think there's something to that with sauce you're able to run experiments on a more gradual level and you're able to. See more detailed results so. The data we got from our services. On like how new features are performing helps us improve the product. For everyone. So increase last uses means we know better how our customers are using the platform what features they enjoy what we should improve. And i improves the product for both sass and self-managed. Super helpful yeah we love seeing the increase traction there and then brian one for you i mean it sounds like you're not seeing any real macro pressure. I don't feel like you're embedding anything into your guide was it a sort of just like the linearity question was it sort of. Business as usual for you guys was there any more back-end loaded nature of the quarter just maybe a little bit more granularity on that side. Yeah absolutely we're super happy with the quarter to grow 74% year over year and then also to add. The largest number about number of base customers and the company history. Yeah when we went back and looked at the sales cycles the sales cycles are actually compressing this quarter so we didn't we didn't see any elongation one of the things that you know as i was preparing for this earnings called listen to a number of other. Ceos and cfos talk. Yeah really with the mission critical applications and software. People are seeing you're moving away from the point solutions into a platform and so we saw a lot of that this quarter and really happy the results that we delivered. Thank you. Next to move on to michael from keybank. Both at once. First city of i think there this is fantastic with what you've done. And i'm it's an environment where people cutting back. Including some reports of developer hiring cutting back so. At that high level. What's making it work that you continue to grow with these rates. In a while some developments cutting back. Most of all thank you very much michael. We're definitely seeing the companies are coming back on hiring developers that they are. Sometimes instituting a hiring. And the situation they're faced with is that they have to do more with the people they already have. And get what i've been able to do that. When they moved to get lab they save on the integration. So the people who before were doing the integration of devil's to. Can start doing something that adds value to the business directly. Second. Oh they're interesting people. Get more effic. We get mad because you don't have to go from point solution to point solution to point solution to get more work done. So. Deacon without hiring it's kind of feels like they have more development capacity. And last but certainly not least. By github helps them to go faster. So they're able to move to the cloud. Close their data centers and free up those people to directly. Song three levels moving to a platform helps. That's why in this environment get lab is mission critical. Companies are willing to free your budget for. It's it's not an option to not do this they have to undergo the digital transformation they have to move to the cloud. Perfect thanks for nothing brian some of like. Last time you didn't have strong upside on the license side of the business. The way that you accounted your standalone selling accounting and so it push the red rex a little bit. Was there any change in what that year over year boost would have been. We're looking for a couple million dollars. Yeah before i answer that let me let me just add on to said comments just a little. Yeah we are cohorts from 7 years ago are still expanding with us today. So you're asking about developer hiring but one of the things that we look at internally is landed tan. And so when we land an account your cohort from 7 years ago or still expanding with us say every single quarterly cohort. Has been doing that and so there is a lot of upsell within all these accounts. That we currently have today and they start with premium they expand division department. Eventually they upgrade to ultimate and so forth and so. We feel that there's a despite some of the hiring things there's a lot of landed tam for us to address. I'm on the license side i talked about the record quarter-based customer ads. We just had a great quarter and you know we do recognize a small portion of the revenue up front. And that's what. Impacted the license revenue. With asc 606 you do an annual assessment. And so the percentage that we use this year versus last year slightly higher and we will use that every quarter for the remainder of this year and then as we go into first quarter of next year we'll do another annual assessment and see where that's at. Thanks brian thanks. Thanks michael. Next question is from rob from piper sandler. Great thanks for taking my question would love to just drill down a little bit more relative to the. The record quarter of base customer ads and. Citizens maturity of the platform is this economic is a channel. Can you kind of stack ring for us. Why you're seeing such success right now in this environment. Relative to this new net ads and then i do have a follow-up for brian. Yeah thanks for that. We believe that we're very early in a big market opportun. Us and their biggest competitor together we're less than 5% of. 40 billion dollar market. Gardner said the devil squat from adoption. 20% now going to 60% over a couple of years. If anything the need to consolidate the need to have fewer tools less integration efforts is only accelerating companies can't afford anymore to spend and solve everything by hiring more people. So that the macroeconomic. Challenges that company faces. Only makes it. More of an imperative. To consolidate to go to the cloud faster and to embrace platforms like it. Great and then brian building a little bit on matt hedberg's question around linearity you did see. Ar creep up and so if we match that kind of a billings days outstanding. Higher than previous quarters so is this linearity is this economic is this big deals are these new levels should be sustained moving forward can you help us out a little bit on that front thanks. Yeah i would just say that the on the. Billing we had two invoices one that's been collected one that will get any day now so. That's on the on the billing that you've seen so the dsos take up a little. And i and i would just. Safe for the quarter there wasn't really anything outside. In the quarter that happened that hasn't happened in other quarters and so. Yeah we landed a yeah we had our we had a record quarter as well with aws and gcp contribution. And so once again another large quarter the largest quartering company history of what they contributed as well. Do those tend to lag relative to to payments. They do not they're relatively same payment terms. All right thanks. And brought maybe to answer that maybe give you an example. We had. Global airline manufactur. Same with this discord. They are. In the business of spending more money right now they're in the business of spending less money. But it is an imperative. Get better. Development security and operations and they became a customer. Disc. Even though. And there's a lot of. Ways in which which every company needs to save money they made the budget available to become a customer. From previously using get. Great thanks for the color. Next we'll move on to joel atruist. Thank you for taking my questions one for said one for brian just to follow up on that sit i would love to get your take on the some of the partnerships that are really driving value for you right now and and how your position with them and brian just a double down on that operating leverage i know you talked about some of the operating leverage driven by. Revenue out performance but i love didn't know what the other major drivers are of operating leverage going forward thank you. Thanks so much i'll go first and let brian add. The most important partn. For us. I don't want to put the hyper. And the important for us because more and more of the purchasing. Happening by these hyper clouds their influential in accounts they have access to the important sea level people. We are important. Italy ass dcp we mentioned we want a gcp award. Because they know if gitlab is in the account they move to the cloud. The fastest way to do the cloud migration is the first get on one platform and then. Not to try to move 10 different point solutions and different. That is way more hassle. It's a partnership that's very symbiotic and we're super excited about the additional opportunities that. In partnering with. Hyper clouds like that and great partners like ibm that we lost to work. Angel on the operating leverage side of me we're seeing operating leverage you know across the business and all aspects. You're one great example i'll give is 2q of this quarter versus two q last year. Last year was 88%. Now i got gross margin and this quarter was 89% so even though it was size growing as fast as it is and cost us more to deliver. We're still putting in operational efficiencies to improve. You are delivery cost. You within the company we pretty much have you built out the management layer most of the net ads that we're doing is for capacity and in r&d to improve you have to continue the enhancements in the releases that we've done. And so you know across the entire business yeah we're seeing operating leverage in in the business model. Thank you very much. Next we have koji from bank of america. Hey said hey brian thanks for taking the questions just kind of a follow up here on the record net new customer ad. You're really really great number there wanted to ask kind of on the average land asp for those customers you know are they coming in bigger now or are they coming in about the same from a historical perspective and how are you thinking about customer land. Isps for the future given all the macro factors that are going on out there. Yeah i'm happy too happy to take that code you thank you the the trends that we've seen we've seen increasing asps across all segments in the business. And so we haven't seen you would expect on some of the reports that people have talked about in the industry that you may see a decline we haven't seen that and so we've seen an uptick across the board. And that's been consistent with all the other quarters. Got it thanks brian and i just want to follow up here for or maybe he said. Call brian i noticed in the press release. Me you announced the partnership with a bunch of companies like dyna trace and launch darkly. To launch this feature open feature so i guess could you explain you know maybe maybe from a high level what is open feature and what sort of opportunity does this unlock. I forget love thanks guys. Yeah thanks for the question so. Open feature is a standardized way to make feature flag. Future flags is functionality that allows you to put mostly new functionality to turn that on and off really quickly. It helps a company to release faster and more frequently. Won't be able to quickly remediate if something gets broken. We already offer feature flags and get loud today but we want to make them better over time and we're excited to partner with dynatrice google launch darkly whole bunch of great companies. In in order to standard. Standard. And we believe that feature flags are much better. It's part of a platform. Future flag. Who came to your source code they need to hook into your observability and would get loud we can make that work right out of the box. Got it thanks guys thanks for taking the questions. Thank you. Derek@coin willie please verbalize your question. Great thanks good to see you guys. I mean. So we've heard from a lot of cios that consolidation vendor consolidation is certainly a priority obviously that that. Caters to your strategy very well and it sounds like that's been a driver would you say that that the macro environment is actually accelerated the rate of legacy displacements in the last quarter or two and are there certain verticals that you would say consolidation is a bigger trend or a bigger tailwind for you. Yeah we're certainly seeing that with customers that say look we need to consolidate and we want to move to fewer tools and that's why we're considering get loud so. Digital when in this macroeconomic environment you have to be able to save people money do more with fewer people so. That's been. A great thing. We are seeing that across over verticals over verticals are cutting back and want to consolidate. We do see that the more cortex companies have and the more tools they have the more compliance they need the more attractive it is to consolidate because. Kind of dare complexity goes almost exponentially. We believe that's also kind of just the future like companies are going to have more and more future. Software projects companies are going to need more compliance whatever industry you're. So it's been consistent across verticals. Great thanks maybe one for you brian last quarter you talked about you know mia having a record pipeline. Clearly doesn't sound like you're seeing any macro headwinds but that could you just compare and contrast what you're seeing out of you know europe versus the us. Yeah i would just say you know we have straw mac or tailwinds around digital transformation and the growing security threat landscape. The pipeline across the entire company is the strongest it's ever been. Win rates have been pretty consistent with last quarter. And we are not seeing deals being pushed. Great to hear thanks. Thank you. Now we move on to jason from william blair. Thank you hi guys. First one for said on their earnings call last week mongodb talked about the consumption base model and linkage to application utilization. As reflecting almost a real-time view of the macro environment. Which according to them is getting worse. My question is how would you compare and contrast were you guys sit relative to mango. And your your confidence in terms of how close you are to feeling macro impact in real time. Yes we're a different different model we we charge per user per year. And we're seeing that. There's a lot of upside for a still so there's a lot of ways to grow within the companies were already at like we're nowhere near kind of having all their users. And we have a lot of room to grow in up cheering from from free to paid but also from premium to ultimate. So. We're not seeing those consumption. I had wings. And in fact as we talked about before. Companies now need to save money and get is a way to save money and make your existing people more. More effective to do more despite having a highly. Brian anything you want to add. I would you same thing i mean we have great visibility and one of the great things about being a radical model is we have great visibility into the revenue. And then you're with having your over 200 open wrecks and be able to see the pipeline. We can adjust anything from a macro perspective. But we haven't we haven't seen anything and so. We're super happy with you know that the base customer ads or net dollar attention rate. You're the operating leverage that we're having in the business and so. Across the board you know we're very pleased with the trends. And then we'll quick follow up for you brian. Can you remind us at a high level on expectations for g who for next year both in terms of opex and revenue contribution. We we haven't given out anything for next year yet on you. Okay but at some point you're going to get some revenue contribution correct. That is correct. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have carl at ubs. Okay great thanks for taking the question sorry about before hey brian maybe this is for you on the on the 3q revs guide. 59% pretty phenomenal but. Optically it's a 15-point diesel. On an 11 point easier compare. So i just wanted to press you is there anything other in the year ago period or in the. Coming october period that might be distorting that comparison any one-time stuff maybe anything related to the ssp issue you call the last quarter to. To share with all of us thank you. Yep thanks for your question yeah we're super super happy with our performance and guidance we beat by 7 million we raise the full year by 12.5 million at the midpoint. We're currently guiding to a 63 to 64%. Your rear revenue grow. And then our guidance includes impact of russia. Yeah the true ops yeah where yeah we don't have fx exposure but you know we we bill and collect in us dollars and so there's other companies out there who you know based on the currency devaluation it's more expensive for them to buy. And so all that we've put into our guidance. Yeah i'm really happy that we've been able to raise the annual guidance and continue to get operating leverage in the business. If i look at the guidance from the beginning of the year we've increased guidance by 24 million. At the midpoint of one q and we're doing this for 30 million last and i got operating income. Okay agreed thank you brian. Thanks girl appreciate it. Next we have pendulum at jp morgan. Oh great hey thank you for taking the questions and. Congrats from me as well. I want to ask you about the the free user limits that your seems like putting in place that will go into october. Of this year i believe. Is it possible to qualify kind of number of users that will be impacted or. How should we think about. The impact of that change to the business or in q4. Cisco. Yeah thanks for that so we want to make sure that our free plan is sustainable so we've instituted storage and user limits and that's going to help us become more efficient. Some of the users will. Up to reduce their usage or leave and some of them will off to. To become a paid customer and that that is baked into our guidance. Okay i understand. And one for brian. The net retention rate seems like it's 130%. Pretty good. Is it possible to directionally understand that number. Maybe in terms of. I was trying within. Particular number directionally. If it is up or down versus. Yeah let me just just a point of clarification we were we report that is a threshold greater than 130%. So it's not 130% and in my prepared remarks i said it was actually consistent with prior quarters. And so that should give you some indication where that's at yo number one thing from a you know from. From a net dollar attention rate is additional seats and then number two is up tearing the ultimate. Got it. Our next question comes from nick at scotiabank. Yeah great thanks guys. You guys mentioned that you know sales cycles are shortening land asps are are increasing. Can you just talk about. Driving that because i think it's something you guys have called out several times recently like. Is it more just you know you guys have a more mature go to market motion now. Is it more that you know the top down sales motion. It's kind of allowing for. Quicker budget approvals just any any color you can give around that i think would be helpful. Yeah happy too thanks for the question yeah when we were getting ready to go public one of the things i talked about was we're adding a whole bunch of new go-to-market motions. Yo up until that time the company was primarily a direct sales go to market and since then we added alliances hyperscal. A channel program and so forth and so yeah we've added a number of new go to market motions they're still relatively early but we're very happy with the progress we've seen. As i mentioned the hyperscaler's aws and gcp combined had their largest quarter with us and company history and we're seeing a lot more deals come through that channel. And so. Really happy you across the board we wanted to be aware of a lot of other comments that were made and so we went and looked at deal cycles and looked at that we looked at asps. And i think it just goes to civiluted earlier we're so early in such a big market. And you people are wanting to get rid of point solutions and move on a platform. To develop you know software better faster more secure and that's what our platform does. And so yeah it was as we. Get greater penetration you know you'll see the results that were publishing. Great and and then just another quick one. You know the federal side of the business. You know roughly 10% of revenue can you just give an update there just given that fiscal year's closing you know how how's that pipeline looking. Was there you know any. Yeah any contribution from that sector that that fell into too cute. Any call around that would be i would be helpful. You were super happy with how we're doing in the public sector and then the government market. And that's. What we're doing is baking to our guidance but we're seeing increased adoption and we're very happy with how that is developing. Great thank you. Our final question comes from mike at needham. Great thanks for squeezing me on guys first question i had was with respect to these. The cell cycles were talking to and. Wanted to see if we could slice it up just a little bit differently here. Is there a way to give a sense for the magnit. Of what the delta is when thinking through those shortening cell cycles. Or better said i guess how much would you attribute. To the. Elevated conversations or engagement that you guys are having with the c-suite what is the durability in your view of these short and scale cycles or is it really just a data point today not yet calling a trend as far as. These motorcycles we're seeing and then i have a follow-up as well thank you. I think you're right on that it's just a data point that we wanted to point out you know is we you prepare prepare for these calls and look at all the data across the board. Yeah this is something that was mentioned or asked about on a lot of other calls. And so yeah i think the awareness of. Just a devops platform and get lab helps and then also the time to value in business outcomes that we're driving. And number of people wanting to get rid of point solutions to get on a platform you know for the efficiency i think all these are key characteristics that you know contribute to. Yeah the shortening of cell cycles. Thank you for that i appreciate it and if i could just follow up with with one of the question was more around the the gitlab v15. Once that you guys spoke about you highlighted three things. One of them being the. Aiml and i think it probably goes back to some of the earlier comments from you guys with respect to. How early we are in this 40 billion tan. But i just want to take blood strokes here for a second if i think about devops like we've been talking about this now. Since i want to say like. 2008 2009 time frame and devsecups. Maybe 2014-2015 time frame and both of those are still. Very very. Now we're talking about dev. Plus ml labs which is intuitive makes all the world. All the sense of the world to me. I just wanted to get a sense again how how early stage are we i have to imagine that the decision to come buying those two workflows. Is based on customer feedback but if you could frame out those parameters in any way i would definitely appreciate it. Yeah thanks for that question. If we look at aiml there's two things happening we're using it to make it l. And a great example of that is coat reviewer still ever now suggests hey this person might be the best person to review your code so that's making gitlab the debit second opportunity. The other thing is. Helping data scientists due to work today they have a completely different tool. And that tool stack. Kind of would would really benefit from kind of the the practices that are already prevalent in. We're starting there now with features like better jupiter notebook gift. And we after launching that we seen the usage of jupiter notebooks in gitlab increase. Will continue to add to. For example. Well our planning is fluid or considering. A model registry adding that to get lab in the future. I'm not sure we will do that but that's something we're looking at. These investments. Will bear fruit over very long period of. So it's not that we're going to be. Great tomorrow but. Showing the seats and together with the wider community. A great convergence happening. That aiml engineers. Have to collaborate with the deaf secops people and vice versa because every significant application in the future will need both. Thank you for that i appreciate the color and i totally appreciate it how this is all very early but great to see how you guys are thinking about the broader picture here and looking forward to seeing more with respect to the evolution of the platform thank you. Thanks so much. With that i'll turn things back over to sid for closing remarks. Thank you for your time today. I'd like to thank our customers for trusting get lab. I don't so like to think our partners and the way to get lab community and all of our gitlab team members for all of their contributions. You all have a big part in our continued success. Thank you very much. Thanks again everyone for joining us have a great day.
