Welcome to colorado third quarter results call. My name is i'll give us a caller i'm from colorado ir. Today's results will be presented by our ceo make of everyone and cfo makeup. After the presentation there will be a q&a jason. And please pay attention to the disclaimer in the presentation as we will be making forward-looking statements. Strong performance considered in our core businesses columnar and hayab. And we have achieved again all time high comparable operating profit. Also orders received increase in all business areas. But on the other hand. We expect that's up like 10 challenges and market uncertainties will continue also going forward. I feel already achieved over 2021 convertible operating on profit level we specified our outlook for 2022 and we now estimate. The power company prof. Really improved by 88 to 118 million. Converted 2021. With that over to you mika. Thank you very much chucky and good afternoon from my behalf as well and thank you for joining the car today again at q322 call. I thought you said our strong performance continued also during the q3. As you know the q3 is you typically a week is quarter for us in the year due to the seasonal fluctuations and being able to deliver. Such a high revenues as well as a record operating profit. During the q3 was a very good achievement from us. I miss specially happy to see it a strong performance our services business with the strategic focus is clearly delivering results for us and our services business is grew by 22%. Even more delightful lisa great progress we are making an hour echo portfolio deco portfolio revenues have actually now increased by almost double 97%. And i already representing 27% of our revenues. The investments we have done in the technology and services to drive to sustainability in our indust. Together with the fastest landscape or our customers are more and more under pressure recording sustainable sol. Is clearly delivering results for. Looking at the market then overall first of all and what do you see from our operating equipment data connected and all over the world. The hyper a high capacity utilization is still continuing we saw a slight decline sequentially from q2 to q3. Which is of course partly explained by the seasonal variation. Overall we see the stabilize stabilization of the data also a year and year obviously a lot of the equipment is now running at the capacity and espeon now able to deliver more and more new capacity on stream we accept. Running hours stabilize at the relatively high level at this. Overall obviously the market answers uncertainty is increasing there. If i look at some of the key indicators for us at the continent traffic is still growing. The container shipping traffic is still actually almost at the full capacity utilization we still see congestion continuing in the ports. Overall the expect that the container traffic cam is still a growing during q4 as well as during the next year. Restart to see some slow down in the in the building sector and construction activity at the moment and an obviously and such as housing start. I think it's also important to remember that when you look at some of these statistics and and we start to see potentially some decline in some of the indicators as well. Restart to decline from historically high levels so if you look at it sort of the absolute numbers now a number of the indic. Over the last 67 years. We are still operating at the very high market activity many of the segment. In shipside vc slow down in ship contracting this was to be expected the shipyard capacity starts to be full due to the very high contract activity in 21 and early part of 22. And that together with the higher prices and inflation in for example still prices. Is clearly show us slowing down the ship orders there as well. Our orders increased in all businesses and to new record high as well now i'm putting that in context one needs to remember there is some positive impact they're coming from currencies. I know so from the inflation now. Overall one would estimate that then our price equipment pricing is about 10% higher than it was in the respected quarter. In in in in in in in in in the 20 21. So overall in terms of the volume of the equipment one starts to use the stabilization of other thing in intake. But the order and the demand is still continuing at the strong level when i look at our sales financial forward. And and a performance a year today we still see the strong demand curve continuing at this. Be strong order performance is is bringing a new all-time high in terms of 10-hour order book which is now stands at 3.7 billion and obviously this is an excellent starting point. Going into the next. Bc no activity in terms of cancellations at the moment i think the capacity utilization runs still very high and obviously the increase in prices and the inflation is also giving us some protection in terms of the cancellation. Together with the different time a contracts that we are renewing including penalty cl. Etc. Again as i said the q3 tends to be our lowest quarter in a year and and the fact that we were able to deliver such a strong performance in terms of revenues and and profitability. Holds the great thank you for all the people in target who have a very hard to be able to make this happen despite the continuing challenges in our supply chain. We still see those supply chain issues continuing. Into the q4 and at least the first half of next year as well so we are in no ways sort of out of the woods in terms of those challenges but we are very hard. To enable those deliveries to happen. Very satisfied with the services this is of course has been our strategic focus area for number of years now and and very clearly the high equipment running hours and especially the work we have done in terms of self-help driving higher spare part capture rates. Better services performance better utilization is delivering results for us. Anderson's strong sales growth for visible in all of our different. Business. The target. But if a strategy focus remains in solving and being the global leader in sustainable cargo flow for our. We are solving the logistics industries. Sustainability issues by investing in technology and delivering better services for a. No exactly almost 6 months ago two quarters ago be enough to refocus strateg. Have you are now actually executing on that. The refocus try that you had three elements on that one. Strategic evaluation of mcgregor business. Plan to exit the heavy cream business in calm. And reviewed operational model to support refocus. I already lost quarter of either able to announce the strategic exit from the heavy cream business in calmar and we are now in final phase of asset transfer in there the deal is effectively now done from our. You're into cute too and q3 they were able to conclude this review in our operational model to support the refocus group. The birth in metric or strategic evaluation is continuing and progressing and and they will update the market when we have any conclus. From that. Recording to operational mode changes we are actually making our businesses more independent. Only more of the capabilities in house to be able to drive. Strategic performance and deliver results. As a result of the changes in operation mode via moving more than 100% from the group and focus areas into the business are. In target we have very successfully developed and driven our digitalization and technology developments partly through the central capabilities. In our group level. Now we believe that they were actually development is mature enough to be able to move all of those assets and especially the great talent we have in our digitalization and technology capabilities. Directly into businesses where the alignment and and answer the integration into our customer facing activities. Will be even better. We are also moving all sourcing activities including direct as well as indirect sourcing into the business areas for them to be able to drive that more effectively. And and sustained we can technology functions also moving to a great extent into the business. No from group point of view this means that the car that came and will be more and more of a focused only on the listed company duties as well as them providing the back office services and process. For our business. The investment. I thought we have done in technology and development and services act now clearly yielding results as you can see from a. Have you keep on so the going down that road our r&d investments grew again about 7%. In q3. Couple of examples of that one in hayabi are really looking to sort of go into the new application areas as well. Toyota biltmore resilience in the business and one important breakthrough for has been a real segment that has been. Not being a sort of a strong point for higher in the past and we have achieved major break. Awesome that. Installing our customer climate challenge is we are delivering increasingly market leading capabilities for example more than 500 km hybrid strad. Just to give you an example those 500 hybrid straddles now operating a yearly more than 400,000 tons of co2. At sort of savings. If i am in in our customer operations. And we keep on investing in the innovation and transformation and be very focused on providing sustainable sol. A great example of that one is that the first in our industries. Hi i'm past no introduce the first first products that i built from the fossil free steel. Last but not least then our services are a pair for me very well and we are keep on adding and driving more advanced. Services an example of that one is the new higher high performance services. That enables us to drive south of the customer optimize performance and help them to be even more. Effective and even more sustainable. In their operations. And with that one i'd like to hand over to me who will cover the financials and the business area. Thank you mika and good afternoon also from my side. That's the first have a look on calamar where we had an excellent. Excellent. Not performance in quarter 3. Soledad continued in quarter 3. Even when taking into account that we were still partially limiting our terminal tractor order intake during the quarter. Colorado screw by 12% and it's also good to remember that we had last year. In quarter three roughly 25 million euros heavy cranes orders. So unlike the light basis comma quarter 3 order clothes for sale 19%. This is also the first quarter for a while when colorado book declined slightly from the previous quarter thanks to go to delivery volumes. Call my sales group by 40% year on year. Delivery is progressed well in all divisions including also services despite continuing challenges in getting components on time and it needed volumes we have seen also delays in transportations. If we clean the car and see impact from sales growth. At the 8:45 would have been 33%. Out of this 33% in calamar roughly 1/3 comes from price increases and 2/3 from volume growth. So strong. Strong deliveries in. In a quarter 3. Commerce profitability improvement was very much driven by volume cross. And then if we look the kind of new car set up so excluding the heavy cream so calm. Profitable quarter 3 pro comparable operating profit was close to 11%. Did not moving too high up which delivered also a very good quarter despite the quarter three being often seasonally. At the lowest quarter within the year. I can call my demand in hyatt was a robust across all i have divisions. Like me i mention entire plans also some new products during quarter three like the r. Florida lottery. Have these happy and attracting also good demand from from the market. Are you upstairs what's up by 23% here the currency impact was approximately 5% units. In high up we were able to deliver both equipment and services reasonably well despite the continuing component and truck availability issues. Auntie not high up also the profitability improvement for very much driven by the higher delivery volumes. Moving to mcgregor which had another another good quarter in the order intake after the 301 million of orders which we won in the second quarter. In my credit or the others growth was very much driven by merchant vessels like a car carriers as well as said in services had a good quarter as well. My credit card order book starts to be now on a very good level. It's already 57% higher than a year ago. However the 4:45 sales was still a fairly small number or low number. Due to the fact that the first quarter is higher orders start to generate revenue. At more or less starting from the second half of. At 2023. Merchant festival and services profitability improved the year and year. While the low marching in certain offshore wind projects still continue to download the overall mac record results. If we look my credit card here today the september comparable operating profit that was minus 1.1% however when we exclude the offshore wind business which has been a very low profitability mcgregor idea today comparable operating profit would be 4.2% positive. Couple of highlights from quarter 3 aurorable continue to increase and like mica said. 50 cent 3.7 billion euros will provide a good basis for our 2023 revenues. We start to have a sizable like a portfolio revenues almost 700 million euros. Yesterday. How did you say 51% year on year growth. I will comparable operating profit has developed a nicely up by 31% very much driven by the good performance in our core businesses comma and high up. The core businesses for the three comparable operating profit. Washington 6% that it's good to remember that this number includes also all. Haircut group overhead so taking a very prudent view on that profitability. We booked the unfortunately still 43 million euros items affecting compatibility in quarter three. 11 million of this is related to the heavy creams exit which we announced in the second quarter. And in that connection we also said that in the third quarter we would book. Shelton court still related to that exit. At least 11 million is related to project the related liabilities. Additionally in order to be prudent that we have booked in a mcgregor a 18 million euro provision. This probation is related to my creditors. Us government that related business. I'll go to three cash flow was a good and this was very much that driven by mainly calamar and mcgreg. Orders related advanced payments. Despite the good cash flow our networking capital is still very much higher than it should be for the kind of current volume levels. Inventory is especially working progress as well as goods in trans. Those have been the biggest reasons for. I've normally high networking capital. This inventory items have been very much impacted by component shortages as well as earlier mentioned transportation delays. Despite having a higher networking capital than normally we have a good liquidity situation. At the end of september our cash was said $430 2 million and committed long-term and use credit facilities with 300 million euros. I will getting his continue to improve now 30% very much driven by good cash flow. And this is a very. Well within our 50% target. Do you have any interest rate on our own portfolio was 1.3% at the end of september. And that we do not anticipate this dramatically to increase due to the fact that approximately 60% of our. Yes with that fixed interest rates. Due today you have strong water 3 we have a specified our full year outlook. We expect the full year to be at the 320 to 350. Half million you are always comparable operating profit this would mean that our full year result would improve by 88-18 million from 2021. We have a relatively wide range in our guidance and this is simply due to the fact that we do not anticipate any improvements in the supply chain compared to previous quarters. Therefore the delivery is to customers maybe delayed with the short notice. And if we don't get the needed component. And that naturally shoot this kind of dealers come those could have any direct impact then. Power profitability. So. Short reminder how about our capital market today before we finalize so we have a capital market stay on 50th of november. And the only will come to that event. Thank you micah and thank you mika so operator we are ready for. Questions. Thank you sir. As a reminder if you like to ask a question please press that one on your telephone keep. To veto your question please press start. Will take our first question for maximiliano severely from credit suisse your line is open please go ahead. Hi hi everyone thanks for taking my question and congrats for the quarter. My first question would be on on the camera business and print it again 9.7% margins. I was wondering whether now the price cost issues that you had in the past are fully normalized or there are still. Sun pricing that that has to come through. And the second if you could maybe comment on how much of the large cranes orders are left to be delivered after after 3:00. Yes in colorado i would still say that the like said the quarter three performance was very much steven by a very high volume so improved volume so we have been increasing prices but in calma we still have fairly long lead times for for the product so i would say that we have been able to maintain the kind of cost and customer price relation. Ratio on a healthy level level but it's a kind of continuous. Constanta kind of. Catching up and fighting against the inflation. What comes to the camera heavy crash all the book we are talking about the roughly 80 million euros of audible. We expect to deliver most of that during next year. Perfect thank you and my second. And my second question would be more on there at the company level so bus camera. Now you mentioned the price increase itself around 10% here on the. I was wondering whether you could comment on the price increases that you actually seen your backlog so what could we additionally see going into q4 and thank you one in terms of pricing. Overall if i look at the pricing in from 21 to. And a year today now at the moment we have increased our prices roughly about 20% in our equipment business. I speak about saying. At the same time you see continuous inflation and pressure is on at some states i decided at least for expecting that some of that would start to ease off when we move to a second half of this year. But very clearly we still despite the raw material decreases there are other drivers that are still driving. Pricing process for our component higher and we have now actually done already. Number of pricing increases since q2. Desoto answer those fun so do a lot text and we've been able to defend our margins on that one. The other aspect in too much in east desoto inefficiency in our operations because due to the supply chain issue so you have not to be able to deploy for example of the direct staff all the time. So the indirect cost has also sort of an increase some more than that has had a slight negative impact on the mar. We've been able to shut off a counteract those. Dos pressure social by delivering higher volumes. Perfect thank you i'll go back in the queue. We'll take our next question for magnus kruber from ubs july is open please go ahead. All right we got me cracking myself on gps i'm staying with with calamar and. And i'm the margins. When there was a it's very strong quarter obviously and this is q3 but how do you see. How do you say that i think you're cute to see. And i think and it didn't turn the material is quite as badly as as we may be very expected to deliver is overall in in q3 or higher. Can we expected for example one large 20 million delivery that's expected to be materialized in q4. And we were able to sleep that already and in q3. But it's good to remember that the core call my business going forward has actually delivered over 10% operating matching for the last six seven years. Overall and and there are a number of measures taking place to be able to drive that to the high level going forward as well so when the proportion of the heavy cream business is declining now quite. As quickly as a meco's pointing out with the back lock the declining. One should expect overall comma marching to shut off and start to clearly improve as well. Okay got it so there was some negative impact but not as bad as anticipated and going forward it should get better. Yeah in commerce case. At like mentioned. If we exclude the heavy change in quarter three results comma. At 4:45 compatible operating profit would have been almost 11% so. Heavy crates watch downloading 2017 call my results and that continues till. To be for some while until we have delivered adorable. Okay good thank you again solid quarter how should we think about seasonality into the fourth quarter. Hey it's a very good question because it doesn't in a way old q3 for us it typically as you know we don't deliver. Such a strong iq3 but with the back clock and a lot of very hard work from the organization and. I would say maybe a slight so the easing off of some of the supply chain issues but they're still considerable and that helped us. And and you showing our guidance for q4 as well and as you saw the guidance for sexually fairly wide. In that sense that i think that tells you the story about the uncertainty and the fragility of our supply chain at the moment so. I think they will land somewhere between those numbers but it's really depends on the how far will i be able to do there any special how well they are able to receive the components during the q4. Actually got it thank you so much. We'll take our next question from johan el. From kep. The lights open please go away. Hi it's your one here. Capital. I'm just a question you mentioned service orders were up. Something the quarter i guess. Currency impact on on that could yourself adjust totally indicate. What the color of the service. Including currencies would. And then. On the mcgregor obviously a good order level but slightly down sequentially now you mentioned carriers being big orders we know that. Orders olympics for for mcgregor but it's kelly so that the good order and take right now. Is quite important considering the divestment process you are in. Are we are we still seeing. Very solid pipeline from the the huge container shipping boom of last year or. What's the outlook for for mcgregor order. Are you on texas 2nd question mark. Yes i mean they're a lot shoulder boom on the 21 and also to sort of a lot level of orders in the beginning of the this year. We'll carry the mcgregor. Did the time from the ship order to our equipment order has been longer than we expected and and for number of reasons so. I think we will still see a good order update regarding the containers and ss have you already said a good demand and it. A car carrier fleet that's as well. On that one and as you also you have pointed out yourself it's a lumpy business so you never know how every quarter will but i would say they're still. Quite a few miles left from the large order boom in 2122. Had to turn into our orders. Additionally i would say that offshore activity very very clearly is is up at the moment it did not materialize into our order set the orders there. I think for 4/5 of the orders there in services and and in the merchant side at the moment but i think there is. Material charities have to be improvement in the offshore demand as well moving into the next. Meet for that service. Yes sir coming back to your services question so the currency impact on services orders and revenues is approximately. Percent units during quarter three. Okay exc. Thank you very much. We'll take our next question from paul no lighting. You from dance to bang your line is open please go ahead. It's panel from dusk bank i just have two questions on mac record still the profitability. I think you have a hot piece. It's a problem approach exploded in profitability. What is the state of this do you expect them to kind of. When are we going to next year and in secondly. About this probation that you made. Just wondering what is this and is this. Therapist got the profession wouldn't pay enough for and and. And somehow escal. Yeah if you look at the mc craig or i think it's first good to know that the revenue is still at the extremely low level i mean historical low levels at the moment so the order intake if you have now started to see coming it has not turned into revenues and and the fact that we are able to deliver. A black sort of comparable operating number it's such a low revenue is a good achievement and that's coming really from the good progress we have made in services and also. Fact that the merchant marine is improving despite the fact that the revenues in there are still. Yes you said the challenges are clearly an offshore side those projects are are sort of progressing. And and i think they're impacting to the next year will be significantly lower than it has been for this year. Simply i think we will see start to see a different mix and ask me because pointing out also we need to stay. We will start to see the revenue improvement moving into the 23 but coming from the order back. Ss well so i think it will be less of an issue. Now clearly moving into them next year. Regarding team application penalty if it's related to the us government project that there was some issues regarding the document handling. Of that one this is our prudent estimate of that one and at the stage that's always understanding of the potential penalty level. Okay thanks can i test about this project. Is this kind of an obstacle for the divestment so that you need to complet. Project first before. Trying to sell the asset or how do you think about. No it's not actually the project itself is i think fairly far down the road it's not particularly large project but then in this kind of issues the penalties are not directly tied into the size of the project actually so. We expect to sort of fan and either have it sold or cover. That's a. Potential exit of the mcgregor. All right thanks. Will take our next question from auntie canceling from scp your. Open facebook. Yeah i guess it's. Just one question on on demand and obviously the volume. Regarding order so i still holding up on a fairly high level and you mentioned that you are still pushing through some. Price hike so. If you look at the business. Which you would yourself. Think that react first to a downturn. Are you seeing any kind of a negative. Sequential. Within the water weekend and have you seen any kind of. Precious on getting the price increases through to your customer base so anything like a weakness that you are seeing at the moment. And then we are still seeing the strong demand continue now of course it gets a little bit more tricky because the inflation. Inflation is kicking in so as i already indicated actually kind of on the actual volume and then a higher band and. Call my order increases spare. A little bit less moderate but still very strong demand obviously there if i look at them our internal indicate to send what pc. Bc no signs of decline actually for example in commerce tonight their sales funnel is actually continuing to be at the. At the very high. Level. So obviously we are fully aware of the market and answer that this as everybody is but it's not visible in our own. Demand. The second question is a very good one we do start to see more push back in pricing increases i i think and it's a little bit funny situation because obviously people start to see the. Throw material pricing decline so already happening for example in steel then again the energy costs are going up to labor costs are going up at the moment but. Reality. Accept. For the marketing price increases in the last couple of months has been. At the resistance has been higher than it has been in the past but we are still able to push them through. All right then i guess you mentioned going up the supply chain issues you expect them to continue what his first half of next year so. Is this more going to say abroad level assumption or. What what are you seeing there and then should we also think that this will kind of continue with the same with the inflation that even though the price increases are improving the delivery makes you still look kind of thing cost throughout. First off of next year. Yeah i haven't at least trust on on improvements on that one at the moment i said there is. If you want to be in an optimistic side you probably see if there's slight easing off on the supply chain and obviously you see. Revenue numbers but then do a great extent it's still very fragile situation and and you know but from day to day and from company to component to situation can change quite dramatically as well. They're still call. And impacting them our supplies for example you have labor shortages coming from that one another labor show that she's used. I think the energy situation and you are might have some sort of surprises for us it is coming winter as well. Not directly for us i think our energy situation and supply seems to be pretty well guaranteed but again. Supplier base is probably more under. Threats there as well. Sure i didn't press the housekeeping question regarding kind of the one of. What was the garden fuck you for how much is left on on the things that you have guided from before. For the full year of we estimate that our structuring cost would be approximately 65 million euros from the ongoing on going communicate with the initiatives. So at 4:44 we are anticipate the lower cost on this this initiative this does not include any micro. Strategic evaluation related. Possibly related course if if we. Have a conclusion on. During quota for. All right thank you. We'll take our next question for maximiliano survey from. Yeah hi thank you for taking my follow-up my follow-up would be on there on the cancellation side. And you mentioned that you didn't really see i'm taking cancellations in the quarter. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on. Sister how much of your backlogger. Contains consolation closes. And secondly. Historically you could comment on how many cancellations did you see during passdown tours across karma mobile equipment and and here. I would say generally speaking and then i look through the different situations we've been through including the final stock prices looking at the covid. We don't actually see a significant change is in calamaran and hayab. In terms of cancellations. And what's a specifically in during the final stock prices supposed to heavy cancellation business in in. Shipping site. But we have not seen significant cancellation so babes going through with the. Hey comma i'm higher business if you started to hire it's good to remember that. Usually then if he hire product he said that's the truck the truck is also ordered it usually serve specific service or business in there. And and i think people are waiting for that one at the moment so. Also as i already said the inflation inflation is a pretty good sort of safeguard on that one as well. We have introduced increasing more cancellation classes in our contracts as well. At the moment i can't give you an exact number on. I've got. If you could come and just maybe on on the magnitude would it be more than 50% less than 50% just. Indiana broad understanding. Yeah difficult to give an exact percentage i mean also during the past that we have had the cancellation courses in our contracts also in higher painting in calam. What has happened now during this last 18. Yeah more than 18 months when. The prices have been picking up inflation has been picking up and the demand has been picking up we have been. Strengthening all kind of making those cancellation classes even stricter. Meaning that that there are higher penalties in monetary terms for counseling counseling the orders. I think it generally mean you look at the indicate the sponsing of course to watch out when you start to be potentially more worried about those points would be for example t. Main event the ready make proxy inventories and for our dealers and and and and and when you look through our dealerships at the moment and dealers the yard. Empty understand some high of cases they're ready for the truck to be delivered so. Everything they are able to deliver golf in the operations right now. Okay thank you very clear and. Maybe my second follow up would be on there on the services business off of cameron high. I was wondering if you could give us a sense on how. How different the margin for services compared to equipment would i be looking at. Something like 20% for for the margin of the service business or is it more similar to. For the divisional level overall. I'd like to keep you in excitement on that one so if you are joining capital market david might give you a little more light on that. Okay so i'll be i'll be waiting thank you thank you. We'll take our next question from john eliason your line is open please go ahead. Yeah it's your one here again i'm just curious about this statement you said. I have moved to 100 employees into the business lines and making them more independent etc i mean the east business line carman here they are very strong businesses on their own with global market leading positions decent profitability etc i'm sure they would be of interest for industrial buyers out there is this sort of preparing for the next step to totally dismantle the congrats before you're tired or how should we see it. I think you know that really if you look at that refocus strategy i think we have very clear milestones for the next step four quarters. I relate to that my trigger exit my potential exit of that one. And and the other i'm sort of things that i described driving terms of operating profit and i think we are now very focused on executing on on that. Strate. Okay thanks. We'll take our next question from eric besola from ingress the line is open please go. Thank you. Pikachu from indonesia. Could you please help us solve the comprising currency and volume triangle regarding. History order. As well in both karma and. Talk about q3 sales i assume. What i'm actually after is did we receive volume drop in columnar and here order. You taking a cute. We did not see volume drop but we didn't i would call it stable. And at this stage so if you have this is very wrong numbers of course but. Let's call it 10% roughly the pricing impact on on a quick equipment side. And and then let me go straight. Currencies you can repeat that again so. Yeah it's a approximately it very stupid between higher panda high up and karma but we are talking about 4 to 5% in or. And it says what. What the currency is provided us a tailwind during quarter three. In baltimore correct yes. Okay very good thank you so much. We'll take our next question from ups your line. Is going. All right thanks for taking my follow up i think you need to you close your books a bit for for terminal tractors for a couple of months. What is staring intuit. The fixed on trucks in north american in september for example where where when demand came back to the truck make us open the bookstore. Bobby had all books closed during the q3. Do i have a certain period of time as well. And and we are quite focused now on trying to sort of serve the customers who have direct operational requirements in terms of deliveries for example dealers. I'm not prioritized effectively and and at this stage. On on that one it's good to remember you look at the camera order saying we still had a closed order book for terminal tractor business for the. Asking if i'm period of the time during q3 then there's 125 million heavy crane order that we are not offering anymore a year ago so. If if you take those into account it was quite a significant order in text increase still in the calm outside. Yeah if we take those into account it's 19% close. That uncomfortable basis excluding the heavy crash orders from quarter 3 last year. 90% growth and then if we think that it's approx 70 approximately 5% currency. Currency impact so we are talking about. At 40% of 14% of girls still in orders. Cancel subway.
