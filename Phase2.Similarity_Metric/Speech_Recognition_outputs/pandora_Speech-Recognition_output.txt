Welcome to the pandora interim financial report for the third quarter first nine months of 2022. For the first part of this call all participants will be in listen only mode and afterwards they'll be a question and answer session. Speakers please begin. Thank you good morning everyone welcome to the conference call for pandora's third quarter 2022 results. I am john beckman from the most relations. I'm joined here in copenhagen by our ceo alexander logic or cfo under spoiler and the ir. Bilalysis who's taking over from me plus christopher montgian and adam ferguson. There will be a q&a session at the end of the cold as usual please limit your questions to two at a time and kindly get back into the queue if you have additional questions. Go to slide two please. Please pay notice to the disclaimer on slide 2 and then turn to slide 3. Alexand. Please go ahead. Thank you john and welcome everyone who joining the cold today. Q3 was another solid quarter. Compared to clean base in 2019 are organic growth in the quarter was 13%. This is despite china dragging down the grove by 8 percentage points. The growth was driven by a main product platform moments. Which continues to deliver. The launch of a lab credit diamonds collection in north america was well received. This is our first collection set in 100% recycled silver and gold. The launch is a transformative move both in terms of business as well as sustainability. I will talk more about this later. All in all the execution of our growth strategy phoenix is progressing very well. As you know we're unfolding a number of strategic initiatives including. Network expansion. More personalized marketing approach a new store concept. And a new customer loyalty program just to name a few. These are all on track. On top of business continues to deliver profitable growth. In the quarter even margin landed at 18.6%. As previously communicated the q4 2022 ebit margin is expected to be stronger than last year. But i just will talk more about this in the guidance for q for a little bit later. I should say that the trading in queue for so far has been in line with the q3 performance. And thereby also in line with the upper end of the implied guid. Fuck you for. I'm sure many of you will have heard that we had a fire in our european distribution center. Over a week ago. Fortunately no one was injured. And all of the inventories unharmed. Our team in hamburg is working hard to bring operations back to normal. In the meantime we have inventory in the stores. And we can also ship directly from thailand. So despite the fire we're well prepared for black friday and the peak trading season. With a very exciting product line. Assuming that the distribution is back to normal in 3 to 4 weeks. Counting from october 30. We expect some but manageable financial impact. Thank you for 2022. And all within the financial guidance for the full year of 22. Now let's move to slide four please. Our guidance remains unchanged and we're on track to deliver on the expectations. For the full year of 22 organic growth is still expected to be in the 4 to 6% range. Well even margin is expected to be 25 to 25 and a half. I think it speaks to the strength of our business model that we are so far able to navigate the elevated uncertainty. In the markets and stay within our guidance. Slide five please. I know a lot of you want to ask us about 2023 and our expectations to potential recession. It's a bit early to talk about 23 and we don't see a global recession creeping into our numbers yet. But i want to tell you how we're positioned to meet such a scenario shoot it materialize. Despite the rising macro uncertainty and the 10th geopolitical situation. We have so far seen only limited. Shifts in consumer behavior. We're confident that our position in affordable gifting will support good financial perform. Even during a potential recession. Our starting point is strong. We have a favorable margin structure. Strong cash generation. Low financial le. And a conservative capital structure. In 2020 when the pandemic hit the hardest and we had significant store closures. Organic growth was down 11%. And we still generated a 20% ebit margin. And almost. 5 billion dkk in free cash flow that year. We are obviously taking prudent customer to protect our profitability. But we believe our strong starting point enables. Us to invest and accelerate. For example a network expansion. During a potential recession and come out stronger. Slide 7. Before we dive into the q3 results in more detail i want to give a brief. Update on the four main building blocks of our growth strategy phoenix. We're executing well which confirms the potential we have ahead of us. The first and most important growth pillar is driving higher brand desire. A brand is strong. We're the most recognizable jewelry brand in the world. One important indicator of brand str. Is the fact that we have kept on growing during the last couple of years despite. A significantly lower promotion level. This clearly suggest. A healthy brand desire. We have recently implemented the global price increase on a select number of it. I'll come back to this point later. Secondly in the design pillar the focus is on driving the car while fueling the brand with more. Pandora moments is the core of pandora and continues to deliver solid growth. It's helped by innovations such as the marvel collection where we recently launched spider-man. Last year we relaunched panorama and this year we have taken our diamonds by pandora to the world's largest diamond market north america. But more on that a little bit later. Moving on the third growth pillar is personalization. Here we're improving the omni channel experience. To offer consumers more personalized path to purchase journeys. Through the use of data we are getting wiser everyday on how to communicate and optimize our dialogue with consumers. With the use of data we can design and create consumer-centric journeys. Supporting our top line growth. The 4th and final pillar is about growing our core markets. I did any purely geographic l. We also include the network and channel development in this pillar. On one hand we keep improving the quality of our existing network through relocations to better locations. As well as the work to develop a new store concept. On the other hand we continue to fill in white space. As well as selective forward integration. As we will discuss later on network development is becoming more visible in the numbers driving profitable growth. Slide 8. I was sustainability parties are integrated into the phoenix strategy. Sustainability is one of the foundational elements of the strategy. And we see that it supports our growth ambition. An align our actions with our values. Are three strategic priorities are low carbon business circular innovation and an inclusive diver. And fair culture. The launch of diamonds by pandora in north america on august 25 marked an important step. To watch ambitions to become low carbon and circular. The lab credit diamonds have a footprint of 5%. That of a mind diamond. On top of this it's the first collection made with 100% recycled silver and gold. This is a major milestone on our sustainability journey. I believe the launch points to the future of luxury. And we committed to drive this important transformation. Slide 9. We have a very clear value proposition. A key pillar of the brand promise is to offer affordable hand finished jewelry. Aligned with this we have created a global pricing architect. Which broadly can be likened to a rhombus. The bottom shop and reflects are opening price point. As i mentioned before we have in the last few years. Successfully reduced the promotion level thereby indirectly increasing prices. Pandora's implemented the more traditional list price increase. After successful testing earlier this year with increased prices on select items in north america. Similar price increases were implemented globally. In early q4. We have focused on items where we've identified a more favorable elasticity profile. It is very important to stress. That we have not. Changed our opening price points or prices and items. Of strategic importance. We will continue to protect the strong value perception of the brand. You can think of this as stretching the rhombus architecture. With the anchor point remaining intact. On average prices were raised by 4% across the portfolio. The change was rolled out in october so it's a bit early to conclude. On the full impact. Slide 10 please. We're very pleased that moments continue to deliver solid growth. This is the number one priority in the phoenix strategy even though the platform already accounts for 70% of our business today. Growth in the third quarter was fueled by a disney collaboration. Where specially winnie the pooh and friends have performed very well. On top of growing moments we also want to fuel the brand with more product platform. A lab created diamonds collection diamonds by pandora is the latest example. Let's have a closer look at the launch on the next slide please. We launched diamonds by pandora in north america on august 25 as i mention. It's off to a good start. To remind you all we have a selective distribution approach. Which means approximately 270 stores across north america as well as online. Sell this collection. We have reached approximately 3% share of total business. I need the stores offering the collection it. The 5% share of. We have a fair amount of stores trading at 10% share business or more. Well the bottom 80 stores are around about 2%. This shows. The concept has strong potential. Our short-term opportunity is to improve the salesmanship in particularly in the bottom. The us market for lab created diamonds is 10 times that of the uk market so we're very excited about this. The launch is another important milestone on our mission to democratize the jeweler market. Of which diamond. Are a significant. We'll also stretching the brand. Diamonds on pandora sale at 15 times the average selling price. For pandora products in the us. As i mentioned earlier we're getting a lot of attention when it comes to the sustainability profile of this collection. In particular the relatively low carbon emission profile compared to mine diamond. We grow the diamonds with renewable energy. And they are set in recycled silver and gold. For one carat gold. This brings us to cover for similar to a pair of jeans. And of course the ring last a good bit longer than. We're ready for very important 4th quarter and have added two carat ring to the collection. We believe this will be popular with consumers leading up to the holidays. Next slide. Now let's have a look at our core. As you know we are well diversified geographically. Let's begin with our us business. Which continued to deliver strong growth versus 2019. As expected it is down versus 21 since we're camping the unusual effects from last year stimulus. We have said all along that we expect to use market to slow down this year. And that was included in our guidance. Europe is a bit of a mixed bag. Uk and germany deliver positive sellout growth. This is thanks to consistent and solid operational effect. France is more or less flat year on year. There are two opposing drivers in this business. On one hand we have continued to significantly reduce the promotional pressure. Which certainly shows up in the short-term sales performance. On the other hand we have been stepping up our marketing effort. Which we see yielding in particular strong progress in terms of unaided awareness. This now must work its way into consideration and purchase. Which compared to the promo changes have a somewhat longer lag time. We see this as a good investment into the brand equity and remain focused on unlocking. The potential in this market. In ital. We see that the macroeconomy is impacting consumers willingness to spend. We record very healthy traffic into our stores. But conversion rates and units for transaction are a bit softer. As mentioned we have only seen limited shifts in consumer behavior on a global level. But italy is the exception. Australia was up 40% versus last year due to temporary covid-19 closures in 21. China was weak as expected and severely impacted by traffic into stores being down 62% versus 21. Again due to covid-19 restrictions. Next slide please. Before i hand over to andres i want to reiterate the network opportunity for pandora which i also highlighted in our q2 conference call. A baseline for growth is strong with a very profitable and cash generative store network. In addition to this we see an opportunity to expand the store network and areas where we don't have a pandora store today. As we said at the capital markets they last year was a great untapped opportunities in making a brand more accessible in many of our core markets. We've carried out an extensive analysis of the real estate network in our top 40 markets. We have map 13,000 location. And is the starting point we have a plan to open new stores in the best 600 locations of those. In the years to come. A network expansion is starting to be visible in numbers here in 2022. Next slide please. We expect to open net $150 stores until 2023. As you can see on this slide the number for 22 store openings are driving incremental and profitable growth. There's a short payback of roughly one year on the capex investment. And new lease contracts on most cases quite flexible and include regular brake clauses. If a recession hits store opening isn't there where we might leaning harder. As access to good locations could open up. It goes without saying that the deals must be very attractive before we engage. We're very focused on expanding the network with quality. And on that note i hand over to unders for closer look at the. Thank you alexander please go to slide 16. The the key message for the quota is that the financials were in line with the expectations and that we are. Trending in the upper end of the guidance. I'll cover revenue and event on the following slides on this slide i'll just give up a comment on the few other kpis on the cross martin as you can see on the slide here it's above. Last year at 76.7%. And the cross margin in the quarter includes around 14. Basis points of temporary hit win from the forward integration that we have been doing during the last couple of months. Networking capital ended significant depth of last year and cash conversion was. That at 0% in the quota. This is mainly driven by higher inventory and i'll come back to that. On a separate slide in a while. But what i want to stress here however is that the future cash generating capacity in pandora is unchanged. And that we expect to be highly cash generative in the fourth quarter as usual. And then also just want to highlight a number which we have not put on the slide here and that's the planned payout. To the shareholders that we will be doing here in 2022. And those payouts equals around 13% of our current. Market cap. Then please go to slide 17. Let's look at have a look at the revenue performance here in the quota organic growth came in at 3%. And that's the the black bar that you have in the middle of of the bridge on the slide. That's the same growth as we saw in the second quarter and that's mean that we are keeping up. Pace on a sequential basis. On a on a freer stack versus 19 then the organic growth came in at 13%. And that's down from the 17% that we saw in the second quarter. As we had expected and all also pointed out when we did the second quarter announcement back in august. Going back to the year over year organic growth of plus free and then as you can see in the bridge here it was driven by sellout of one. Off growth and then network expansion adding three points to the growth. And as alexandra mentioned then the growing the network is a cold part in in our phoenix strategy and it is really visible in the bridge here and in the growth in the corner. And then as you know we have seized the business in russia and belarus early this year and that tracks down the organic growth by around one. Here in the third quarter. Then please go to. The next slide 18. And this is the ebit martin. Bridge and the key message here is what we're put in the. Box the dotted box in the middle. Showing that the adjusted comparable even margin. I continues to be strong and is. Roughly unchanged the slightly off versus the third quarter last year. Outside of the the daughter box we have a isolated the temporary fix for both last year and this year. And if you look at the elements to the right. And then with just to put in one element to call out for the ebit margin this year. And that's the temporary fix from the forward integration that i mentioned just. Tracking down the even margin by 140 basis points in the quarter. And excluding that effect. And the even margin in the third quarter this year would have been. 20%. 20.0. Then please go to slide at 19. We have. Added this slide because we wanted to make sure that the message on our inventory is. Crystal clear. As you can see on this slide our inventory is up 2.2 billion corona since the end of last year. And that's a deliberate and planned increase in our inventory. First of all we have been building inventory ahead of peak trading season and there's nothing on unusual about that. Secondly we have deliberately added. Risk premium so to speak to cater for covid-19. And the potential supply chain disruptions. So victor key message everyone. They put forward is a a that the inventory composition remains very healthy. And be that we see a low ris. Off markdowns on the inventory. Another way to look at what's something happening in the on the inventory in pandora is in terms of weeks of cover. And inventories by the end of this year not not by the end of the third quarter by. End of 22. I expected to be around 4 billion danish krone. And. Corresponds to a weeks of cover of around 30 weeks. And that's a 3 weeks up from 27 by the end of 2021. And that 3 weeks increase. Partly reflects the risk premium that i just talked about. And partly a decision to increase availability. Of individual skus in our product portfolio. Because availability has a direct impact on the conversion rates and thereby on our revenue. Then please go to slide 21 and a few comments to the guidance. The third quarter trading was in line with our plan and the key message here is that we keep our organic growth guidance on changed. The low end of the guidance range assumes that the trading conditions will worsen during the remaining 78 weeks of 22. And obviously the macroeconomic outlook is indeed associated with the elevated uncertainty. And then please go to the next slide and the ebert margin bridge. Be even martin guidance is also unchanged. And the fourth quarter will be the most profitable quarter of the year man as usual and in line with normal seasonality. As we communicated early on the 4th quarter eid margin. Is expected to be relatively stronger than last year. And the third quarter martin was correspondingly lower and that's due to both facing on revenue but mainly on. On the cross side between the two quarters. Then please go to slide 203. Before handing back to. Alexander then let's have a look at what the guidance implies for the rest of the year in in q4. The 4 to 6% organic growth for the full year. Implies and organic growth for q4 of between -3 and + 2. And that's what you can see in the upper part of the of the slide in the middle. And then in the lower bridge you can see that this equals between 11 and 17% organic. Versus 19 here in q4. And just to repeat myself then the upper end where would be. Out of the guidance would be an acceleration from. Percent a percent growth on a free stack in the third quarter. To 17% here in q4. And the lower end scenario assumes the trading conditions were worse. During the remaining part of q42. Macro the macroeconomic environment. And then i'll just finish off with. A comment on the recent fire that we had in our european distribution center as alexander said. We're still assessing the financial impact of the fire. But keeping that peak season is coming up then the speed of reestablishing operation. In the european distribution center is. Of course very important and every day counts. But assuming that the center is back to a normal operation in free to fall weeks accounting from october. Then we expect some but manageable commercial impact financial impact in q4. In addition to the some top line impactable of course be a range of extra cost due to the fire. And then. The insurance coverage. Obviously plays a role in the financial impact here in q4. And that's both in terms of covering the extra cost. As well as well as covering a lost revenue. All the lost cross profit. But nick kn. We expect the impact of the fire to be manageable and within the financial guidance for for 2022. And that i'll hand it back to alexander and the slide 25. Thank you andres so to summarize q3 was another good quarter for us. Execution on phoenix is progressing well with great momentum on the many strategic initiatives. We're ready for pick trading with an exciting product lineup which amongst other things include spider-man in the exciting marvel collection. And the new two carat lab credit diamond ring in the us. We're on track to deliver as understood the guidance for 22. We are confident that our position in affordable gifting will support financial performance. Even during a potential recession. But having said that we are taking a number of precautionary step. To protect the profitability during times of uncertainty. And before hand it over to the operator for the q&s q&a session. I will point out that i do not have a crystal ball. I know this morning i've spoken to number of journal. They will ask the same question what's going to happen ahead of us i don't know. We will speak to what we see and we're happy to share those metrics with with all of you but but we you know as much as we wish. When you we don't ignore exactly what the. Look for us but we're ready. Okay the operator please. Thank. If you wish to ask a question please dial 01 on your telephone keypads now to enter the queue. What's your name's announced you can ask your. If you find your question is answered before it should turn to speak you can dial at 02 to cancel and also's question comes from the iron line of kira better see me of jp morgan please can i have the online is open. Hello hi thank you very much for taking my question the first question is on on the inventory please and i appreciate the bill that you put the bridge that you are provided but i was just wondering on the season i'll build the app for memory it seems to be a much bigger buildup i had a trading versus what i remember from previous years so maybe could you please. Pictures of color around that and then how should we be thinking about the what you mentioned about the 30 weeks cover in context of your expectations for next year's revenue please and the second question on price increases that you've implemented i appreciate it's still quite early to comment on the reaction of the consumer but i was wondering if there is any early signal that you can discuss and talk about from what in the last month whether you're planning more for next year please thank you. Yep thanks kiara for those questions and on p.m. inventory it's true that the seasonal build is. If it's bigger than than last year. And it it links into the the comment actually not on the second part of the question about the weeks of cover that we have seen that they have had. That we can increase availability a bit more than where we have been operating. And in the past so we are. I also hit of the peak season building up a bit more inventory that we've gone in in recent years to make sure that. And they're pumping up. Availability across our skus. I'm at a little bit more than what we've seen in. Across the year but not least during the q4 of the last of the last couple of years. And then of course as you kind of point out you can do a try to do a bit of mass but if we say 4 billion corona off of f1 billion of inventory by the end of this year and 30 weeks of cover and it's it's deliberate that we're giving you the wrong numbers on the on the inventory but we wanted to explain that we have deliberately. That's powerball it's an op processor merchandising discussion decided to increase the weeks of cover by by a few weeks because we see that that it implies. A very low risk of additional inventory right down. At what actually helps us to. Yeah. Increase availability thereby increase conversion. Across all our network and there. And that by revenue but the other reason for partner putting out the 4 billion corona route number. That is that we want to make make it make it clear that we will see a very very nice cash conversion here in in the fourth quarter that's not unusual but we will give him that the cash conversion for the first. Three quarters of the year has not has not been good so to speak for a due to hire inventory we wanted to stress that with that we will see a very healthy cash conversion here in nq4. On the pricing so a couple of things. So first of all it's roughly 1/3 of of the assortment that we've touched as i mentioned we have not touched opening price points. I'm not touched you know critical aspects of the assortment where we know. Customers are very more sensitive. At we ran a little bit of a test different cells earlier this year to try to kind of eat out where elasticity this would allow. For for some price action. And those are the the pieces that we have moved now it's 4 weeks in and i you know it's october numbers we haven't hardly closed the october books i haven't had time to actually analyze this. Item by item to be perfectly honest with you but i would also not expect. Any major i haven't heard anything back. You know markets are quite quick to give me a call if they're unhappy so so silence means it's good but but i would you know. You know give you a rain check on this one and then come back when when we have some more robust results. And that probably also then answers your last question and are we planning anything for next year i think we would want to see that the sticks. Across the globe before we make any any major additional moves on pricing. So i think that's kind of where we are. Thank you very much and just a small follow-up on the price increases this was an action that was taken globally or and have you seen. I mean i guess i need any region or any country be having a bit differently around it or not nothing to call out at this point. No i mean so the way we did it we we did it in in three trenches in the us so we're kind of feeling our way into this. And that happened over you know later q2 in in stages and then we kind of did the whole thing globally in the beginning of october. So so it's it's way too early to to call out anything today. Great thank you. Thank you and that's question comes from the line of last problem of carnegie please go ahead to your line is open. This is the first congrats with. Another good. Two questions from me. When is you you mentioned that if you are going to see bigger recessionary impact. You have a sort of cost to action plan ready. I just wonder if you can put some words on. What kind of costs. It would be looking through with you and which kind of investment you would be looking to. Taste differently if that happens then a second question. Goes to the. Comma you made on slide 14 and your presentation of. Adding 600 stores and that's creating a 1.5 billion. An incremental apiated at low ris. That would everything else equal at close. 200 pips to your epic mar. So sure if we take the guidance from this unit that should bring you up to. Around 27% i know your long-term matching child is for 2023. Didn't we are talking beyond that but i just wonder if you can. Confirm that calculation then maybe can comment on. In addition to what you get from storage conscience should we still expect some kind of leverage. If if you grow on. Same store. Same space is also and. Should we assume there will be less of a track from forwarding to probation. Long term. Basically i'm trying to imply your matching shirt. It's up to watch the 30% point rather than. The 27%. Did that question make. Got it it got a bit complicated. Will will try. I know we'll see what we get to so on maybe i can start on the cost containment so it's just to be clear it's not like we're sitting in our hands waiting for the recession before we pull these levers we're acting on that now so that we kind of stay fit if if you get the analog. So we have renegotiated all of our immediate contracts globally. Which which is something that that that's good for us. We have. Over the last. Few years as you know if we've been trying to rebuild the the pandora engine we've added a lot of projects throughout the entire value chain. But of course what what ended up happening here is in many of those instances. There was not resources in place or capabilities in place to actually execute on those programs so we've added people and we've added money. And that's a little bit kind of the motors of brandy that we've had for the last 2 years. Now looking into the future and making some kind of. A broad-based view on you know things might get a little bit harder coming into the future. We've said that we're not going to add any more new projects. And therefore we're not going to add incremental funding to that nor incremental head count against that. So essentially we're saying we have a whole slew of great things that pandora wants to to do. But right now we're pacing ourselves a little bit and we moving some of these projects out in in time and therefore we need to manage. The project that we have on hand with the existing resources and by that you know there's an active cost. Containment now should the world turn. Soundier than then we believe then we make kind of put some of these back into the pond i also want to stress that we're not now only focusing on short term. In the in that kind of project basket we have things that are good to continue building the long-term health of the company as well as of course some of the short term. So it's not like kind of we just kind of. Stopping to do the important building blocks of the future of the company. So one example it could be that you know we launched the loyalty program which we spoke about in q2 and then of course there was a plan to do a very. You know fast global rollout so now we say or maybe we don't do the rollout next year. We we stay maybe in the one or two countries where we've spent the focus on. Continue furthering that because we can do that with the existing team. And then you know as we see how the world shapes up then we can decide. Put the foot on the accelerator or. So i can't i'll probably stop there and then maybe handed over to anders to try to. Unwind your network question. Thanks i'm exciting i just building on what alexander said on your first question we've had. Essence of the the idea of. I'll have potential. I have some metro weakness recession starting building earlier this year we've had discussions in the leadership team and then obviously as. The situation develops it's become more and more. A concrete so that that is quite a nice decent range of of concrete initiatives that we. We are looking at i think in this context we have talked about before they've been running a couple of. Zero based budgeting exercises for those of you who have been at the business school somewhere in the world and your family but that terminology we. We've done that initiated initiated that some time back we've been running a global media tender just a patient just been completed. Everything they have some opportunities in our point of sales material cost that's one of the things that we're looking into. On the production side there's. Some things that we are looking into on exactly how do we. As of the design the products is the smarter way to design them so to speak from a. Perspective without impacting. A consumer perception some of this you can say well that's no normal business but be able to dedicated it even more attention given what was happening. Happening around. But then on to your second question and i'm actually kind of happy that you asked the question. Because that's that's why we put it into the the presentation because i think it it's a. Super strong position to be in to have a network that's that wide as it already is that. And the footprint that we have and then and then still. Yeah yeah we can open up a decent range of of new stores. I've been a very very healthy financial profile and even being a margin and creature to your to your. A compatibility to the group even margin so you're. Just taking this. A growth liver that we're writing on slide 14 that would translate into everything else equal as a higher even margin once we have opened up the those 6. New stores that stick number one well at high even martin then. Of course that there might be that will be separate discussions as part of the annual planning on. To what do you want to invest in driving future growth driving. The top line going forward. But it's two separate decisions that one it falls to the bottom line and then step two of course what do we need to invest. To drive. Stable consistent top line growth in in the years to come. But. That's full also for future guidance discussions. Thank you very much. Answering. Thank you alan exclamation point. Yes hi good morning it's alternate. Beauty parlors example. Priscilla i like to come back and visit. Imagine if it's marginal question from from new stores. In the castle. Cruise management. It was not. Between the. One store opening. What are those change i know that you had. Some exp. Real estate. Things like that. Any sort of granularity and and what. 40%. Numbers. And. The future. I understand. Original. Beatbox i don't. The us market. Profitable. The highlighted that there was. 1040 busy points. The head. From forward integration but yet. Over. By. Maybe a quantified. Other drivers that. You know what pos. Thanks for thanks antoine for those. That questions i on the operation of the stores that we have opening and are taking over from from our partners. It is it is true that during the last couple of years. As part of both program now but also the last reorganization that we did in march. 20 to a bit more than 2 years back we did establish. At a couple of of new stuff centers of expertise on a centered around for. Managing the network and then operating the store so to. New function so in general. And i think this is one of. Alexander's favorite topics as well i think we actually getting between pretty strong and operating the stores we have i think have. And also see that in general when we when we take over star. From from all partners in many cases most cases we can actually run them across the different retail matrix even even better. With the expertise that has been built up or over the last time or the last number. Number of years so that's part that's that's two teams that has been built up it's. And dedicated network management team. That. So overseas in the network and and constantly works with where where do you want to be located in in on which street in which mall on what's on what floor in the mall and on that floor whatever exactly is the right place for us to be. And don't know how to negotiate with landlord and and run that as a very very tight machine around the opera at the last network that we have on. Both concept stores but increasingly importantly also across other types of stores shopping shops kiosks. And then you have a retail excellence team. As well reporting into our cco matino. Sharing best practices across our network on on exactly how do we how to actually execute in in the stores which is a sort of super super important topic as well. Just just to add i mean i think we've also. Added resources locally of a very different caliber. So this has been become a priority because it sits in the phoenix strategy and the key items in phoenix that's where we kind of try to put our best foot forward. And i think this is another example where when we standardize the metrics across the globe we can leverage our scale. So here in this instance we're leveraging insights across the globe quickly you know. So we know where we get the best bang for the. So i think we just much much smaller operators in this space and i wasn't here in the antoine when you talk about the history so normally i stay away from making comments on that because it's not fair. But my sense is that our approach now is is much more driven by a high quality outcome versus just quantity which i suspect there was a little bit of that going on also if i look at some of the locations that we have. In in our network you know we're in the right mall but we definitely not in the right place. That will not making those type of deals anymore so either we get the right location with the right terms or we walk. So so that's the strength of of having you know a much more professional operation. The control of. To a question about the the gross margin. As always quite some some moving parts in the in the cross martin but if i should just keep making it simple. And then if you go back to the third call of last year thailand was quite hard hit by by the pandemic and we spend quite a lot of money. In insecuring operations in thailand to avoid being being hit by. Too much by the pandemic or ultimate and lockdown. So and that's 120 basis points of hit wind that we had last year that we don't have this year and that that's probably the most. Tangible and biggest. The peace in the equation of y cross martinus is operations last year. Let me just. Thanks for providing that granularity but maybe just on on a. Uncommitted things on the rose mountain. They already truly. To call out this quarter and there. The remaining parties is really like. The community members. You can drive. About body types of fat question we had them at drac from the track from foreign exchange and commodities of 770 basis points in the quarter. And that's i think it's from memory it's actually around zero on fx and then all the all the track is high silver prices so the 70 basis point is. Hi hi silver price. So that that tracks them all the way and then. And then this is the last component on why the cross martin is still up then is. I made a question of channel mix that have a bit on average a bit more in our own. On channels revenue this year and then. The constant work that we're doing on on the. Efficiencies plays up a bit of role also that's not. Northern any of the impact yet on a from the asp increases that that's still bits and pieces in q3. That we can talk about when we get to q4 whether that's. Gross marching impact. Thank you and i'll next question comes from the line of martin bruno at nadia please go ahead to your line is open. Planet anderson alexander thank you for taking my question and congratulations on yet another strong performance and a very difficult environment. I have two questions if i may and then i'll jump back on the que. I also said you want to operate in in the affordable luxury segment and. I completely appreciate that it's early stage with the price increases but but the obviously have done a lot of research on this and i was just curious if you could. Provide some details on. What's the full scope of for the price increases just down the line if you can share your thoughts on that. And then just looking into q4 that. Don't really a lot of retail companies that undike you have been hit by a shift in consumer sentiment while having really large invent. Does it see any risk that competition for the consumer's attention will be. Extra difficult decision and and i would like to hear just how how we plan to navigate. That's very difficult environment thank you. So on on the pricing as i think i said to kiara is it's too early to say what we can do going forward because one thing is. To do the kind of small cell. Testing where you get an indications another thing is to go global then then you'll see the. Impact of it so i think we should simply need to kind of. See how it works in the next i don't know month or two and then then we'll take a stand. I think it's also important to note that. Well you can take pricing an opportunistically to drive revenue and profit. But we want to be very careful of of a kind of cooking up the value equation of pandora because we know when we did in the past. Consumers react then they react with their feet. And and losing a customer with the lifetime value that we create with our business model is just not the right thing to do so you know you can be. How do you say penny. Penny foolish impounded smart or the other way around sorry i don't get that correct but you get the drift. So i think when we meet next time then we will have some robust data points you should know me by now that we we work on data. So so that's kind of how we run the company. But but. The products that we moved pricing on suggested in the testing that we had done that they had a lot lower elasticities. Then let's say the opening price was because we obviously tested that as well just to kind of. Let's say we confirm our our views prior and and it still holds. Holds true so so it's important that we allow people to come into the brand then they will have the opportunity to choose and that and that's typically what ends up happening over time. Then on the inventory. I mean one thing to say is. Where we increase our inventory position is on a high runners. Which means that if i don't sell it now i'll sell it at some point. So this is this is not the type of inventory that maybe we had in the past. When we overproduce the over. New items and then the new items flopped and then they were out of season whatever and then you end up with having to kind of go. Go to end of season sales type of activities if if you've noticed. In the last 3 years or end of season sale keeps getting smaller and smaller because we simply have less and less. Inventory that that we want to get rid of at rock bottom pricing so. So i think i'll merchandising efforts into space are are really yielding a lot of good good benefits for us. Competition. Can i test it it was actually more to your sort. It's it's not so much your inventory levels it's more. Looking at sort of the retail industry in general having really high inventory and i'm guessing that i'm on my surface a little bit worried. And that you know you could see that the other retail companies would you know really just a dump prices in order to get consumer attention. And that could sort of affect the affect your holiday sales. Yeah i don't know if you have any sort of fair thoughts on. I mean here i'm on purely speculative ground but all i can say is that the efforts in terms of marketing activity as well as promotional activity in the next. 6 to 7 weeks is very competitive. So i actually don't think this is the. Unless they of course they go half price or they do something completely. Well you know then they will that's what they will do i will not follow down that path. Cuz i am conscious about making sure we keep our brand healthy and desirable so we're trying to win this. On you know having a competitive level of of promotion. But we're not going super deep we want to win this with you know good designs. At at with a good customer experience. Being present and with good innovation dot that's that's the retort so you know i will not go down that that rabbit hole i think it's wrong. Thank you thank you very much. Thank you and all that's question comes from the line of paradise of lbc please go ahead to you online as i. I thank you morning i just have one follow-up and it's on the marketing spend which i think is down about 140 basis points a year on year. Could you maybe just give a bit more color as to. What the rationale behind that is i think you mentioned in your earlier comments that you've renegotiated some of your contracts with your. With your partners so you have maybe how much of the of that decrease relative to sales comes from cost savings and how much of it comes from her from an actual step down in marketing spend and then just you know are you still reiterating your full year marketing spend corridor which i think is between 13 and 15% of sales the reason i ask is because in the third quartile. As i've said in the past the 13 to 15 is kind of a bullpark number. It's an annual number you know it will move between the quarters. So we we are not changing any of that. Part of the saving is being reflected in the q4 spending so even though i spend an absolute less. Actually my my output let's say in terms of the trps or grps whichever measure you want to use. Is it still going to be at a very competitive level. Then the only other thing i would say is. If you compare your own year. We we launched diamond. Only in the us in q3 not global what we have in the base. Is a global launch support for a pandora me last year which was an elevated sp. So we kind of comparing apples with bananas when you compare one country versus the globe. But but i think that for my modeling stamp and then it from a strategic standpoint 13 to 15 is we will remain at that level because i think that's the correct level by the look of it. And in fact we could even probably spend a bit more if i'm to believe all the modeling that i see but right now being prudent that's the corridor in which we will. Play. Okay thank you. Thank you al next question comes from the line of michael license. Yeah thank you very much supposedly i would like to ask. Pandora. I don't care what you talked about 50% of consumers on you to pandora. Could you just talk a little bit about the who they are where you where they coming from and are you seeing any. Cheap purchases. Maybe into it to other pandora product. And my second question is just on the. A guidance so. And i'll speak the 5%. Revenues down from 6%. Should we also expect this. Lower going forward also. Eat the new stores and and so forth in plano if you could just add a bit of. Call on that. So i'll start them on the diamonds i mean we're what seven seven weeks since i think i wish we had repeat purchase after 7/8 weeks. Typically don't have that even on our moments platform. So that's probably a little bit early. If you look at the profile and again. Be you know bear with me that the data set is is relatively short in in time. We see that the profile of the customer. And if you take uk. The midpoint was a millennial and then it went up age from there so he went kind of gen x. Part of this is obviously the purchase it might not be the end user so it could be you know men were buying to women that that's always. Complexity we have what we've seen so far in the us is that the midpoint remains the millennial but actually it's going. Younger. So it's going towards the the millennials which i think is quite interesting. It's not surprising if i look at the research which suggested that. The younger generations. Particular gen z's and and younger millennial. We're more aware of live created diamonds and also much more open to this idea if i compare to all the generations. So the kind of profile we're seeing in the first 7/8 weeks. Supports that that research that is a younger cohort coming through. And that's pretty much all we know at this stage. And then michael on your question on on the on capex this is. This is pure. Your timing and facing between the years so that's that's no. It's a structural or permanent. The change in in the capital of so what what we said back at the capital market day and a bit more than a year ago. I still stand. So that's the reason from going from 6:00 to 5:00 there's a little bit of. Facing on. On our investments in in the manufacturing. This that's a little bit to pieces on. On the network as well as well the store network not so much the new stores but more on on the timing of refits. And then. That's actually when you look at it from. A percent of revenue that's a bit of fx in it as well because. Revenue is up because of a stronger dollar and that that's actually i lose the percentage and a little bit. It's in the it's in the decimals but but no no. Structural change on on the cabbage level. Great thank you for verifying and certainly interesting on the the new pandora clients coming in the door. Thank you next question comes from the line of freddy wilde at jeffreys please go ahead of your line is open. Good morning everyone a couple of questions from me all on current trading please so i will use a country in line with q3 does that mean the +3% you're on year organic grow. Was it plus 13%. 201. I'm going. And then in terms of details are the trend similar cross regions or have you seen any major. Differences in the. 3. Yesterday and any incremental trading down or mix. Mobile. Coming in. I love crossword thank you. Thanks i am i i can start out with the. Couple of comments one is on the contrading when we comment on it actually a good clarification it will talk about you over here. When we when we say that this is in line with with q free because actually when you when you look at it versus versus 19 that's a couple of other of dynamics and at play. Because. On a free year stack and then. The. Organ. Gross and sell out gross last year actually developed in. In in in the in different directions i let me. Find. The numbers hang on a second. But it's it's your member saying that we're trading pretty much in line with the 1% sellout growth and 3% organic and that be sold in the. In. Peppa. Look at it from. Sell. An organic growth versus 2019 as i said in one of the. That one of the slides then the. If we keep trading like while you're gone for the the first number a couple of weeks or 5 weeks or so for of a q4 then that we would see an acceleration. On the organic growth in q4 so even though it's it's same speed. Yeah but yeah it would mean an acceleration towards 17% organic growth versus. 19 here in q4. And but i actually also at an acceleration from. A. Perspective for giving that if you go back and look at at last year if you go back to the numbers that we disclosed to answer then. The the sellout grow. Between 21 and 19 that last year went from. So i can't see 9% in the. In queue free to 12% in. Iq phone. So. So if we have flat sort of video over here thank you for that actually would mean an acceleration also on the seller cross versus. But 2019 so a lot of numbers. To keep her to keep track of what most importantly it's a comment on our year over here you'll be a trading. But i think. Hesitant to go into more details about looking at on a country by country a level is now with just 5 weeks in but there's no no shifts in the pat. Compatible. And in queue in q3 the most important. Maybe being that australia obviously now camping a lot of lockdowns in q3 that's not the case for fuck you for also the q4 numbers. Look different because it's very different. That base in q4 off of 21. Thank you very much. Thank you all next question is from the line of class schedule at nicorice please go head to your line is open. Yes no way two questions a related to a diamonds by pandora and first of all. Could you tell me a little bit about the weather there the launch in the us has been supported by a lot of of marketing in in the quarter. And secondly what kind of margins are you seeing if this for this product that would be my my two questions. So. It is an interesting for me a lot of marketing. If you ask the us team they think they want more money versus what i'm willing to give them i think they've had a sufficient. Amount to generate the aw. Required. It is less than what we had in the uk. Because of course trading and conditions are a little bit different this year than last year but it's been. You know i think it's been a decent amount of money. Supporting the launch. What the other thing which we learned last year also. You know roughly half of the awareness. Is generated by the impressions when people are either passing our stores or when they're inside our stores. So if you look at the quality of execution this year we spent more money on stronger in store you know. First of all the windows are better and also the way it's been merchandised in the store. In those us stores have been i think of a much higher quality so so half of that journey i think we've done. Just by by being better in the in the store but it's it's a sufficient amount of. Spend that we put against it. And then on the on the marching in the diamonds business. Did the cross marching and if it's not all that is is below or some classical business if you can call it that. And and more. No limit 50s of cross martin so let's call the 20 points below the classical the classical business at least that this is where we're starting out. And then once we have that the diamond business of scaled up so to speak and and i'm a bit more than. 888 weeks in after lunch. Then it will be. And running at an our target is to run it at an even margin at group level and and above. So it so at least as of even martin neutral on a group level and. Hopefully and a little bit accretive on on a group level so it is it's a different margin profile than if you look at the moment business a timeless. I don't want. And i have but i'll be in from a percentage point of view obviously the per unit the absolute amount of a bigger much bigger than. So the average product sold in in our in our classical. Business so that means that. Q free and q4 as an sv the ramp up and start it it is. Martin diluting ultra on the altar on the bottom line. But that's yeah that's deliberate and as planned and. A price so to speak we're waiting to pay to venture into a very very attractive and interesting space force where we do see that we have. A growth opportunities in the years to come. Great thank you very much. Thank you and i'll next question comes from the line of these singlehurst at scope and sex please go ahead. Hi good. And it's the color so far and follow up for me please firstly just on. This is more qualitative but is there anything. What. But you're you're retail. You're saying anything. You know what obviously all very concerned about a slow down the business is behaving much. Will strongly and very rob. As you mentioned going into. Year-end but it's great to see but is there anything that. You can send all you've been having discussions with wholesalers with a little bit more cautionary and i suppose it's really relative versus three months ago. And this is at the beginning of the year. And then secondly a couple of follow-ups on the inventory. I want to end it. Just give us a little bit of a color on the split between. The seasonal and the carryover you know what's new and what's the evergreen in. There's a. Performance between. At moment and me within. That's great this as well. And then the second follow up on inventory. Is it possible to help us think about. Imp. Forward integration. Key. The grace mar. And i'm modeling there thank. So on your first question on the partners i mean if i look at where we have the the larger partner networks that would be. A us and australia had the opportunity to go down. And and meet them and i'm at the kind of franchise account so that we have in place. And you know they're they're having a pretty good comeback of course the prior year was was hard. Well you told the kobe closures but this year they're having a positive run. Add it and they're actually performing quite well. So so i think it's more positive signals than anything else. And in the us of course last year they had a record-breaking year so they made a you know they had a very very good year as did we of course. In the us this year a little bit slower but again this was anticipated. And you know i think everybody's managing their their cross structures so so we're not we're not getting any. And it let. Hard or harsh conversations with them i mean this was all expected so. So nothing really on on that front and and those are the two main. Main kind of franchise networks are worth talking about. Baby yeah on on the region of the questions on. Inventory and forward integration starting with the last one the we had the 140 basis point of tracking cub. Free it would be a bit lower in q4 and i was actually just trying to look it up so i can give you a precise answer but i. I i can't find yourself on top of my head but it will be a little bit lower in in q4 and 140 basis point of it in the. In the in the third quarter. And then on the composition of the inventory. By far the majority of the inventory is. Hi runners. So. Some products say what if you don't sell it in in q4 we're going to sell it in q1 or q2. Next year. So that that that's also why we go out and and stress that we see that the risk of markdowns is is quite. Quite limited given that. I've been on upset if you don't have fashion. Fashion jewelry company. I don't know whether that helps but then the majority is on the side of the top 5. Sk used in the company's by far the majority of our inventory. Yeah i mean just the way we we buy this internally is actually to two different streams because we do the assessment on the new items based on on research and then we buy according to that. And then the evergreens that's more you know an arithmetic. Calculation looking at the turns. There's much more math going into to that so i think the opposition on that is very very high. But i don't think that we've ended up with a lot of. Stuffing our end of season sale in the last. Let's say. 304. The times that we've done it with newness that that. That that's kind of become quite rare. Really helpful thank you to myself get this. Tour. I'm in europe. I can currently thank. So i think that now i don't have the number stuff on my head but. The french business is not so dependent on on tourism. If i compare to to spain for instance. Suspend they had a good comeback this year. I think they initially they thought that we would get like 70% of the tourism back i think it's. Closer to 90 or or they're above so it's almost back to 19 in spain. In in france wasn't huge in italy also isn't a huge part of the business i think it actually the spanish business that that that's mostly affected but that seem to be coming back on that note though i mean it's interesting if you look at australia for instance. There versus 19. There in down 80% on tourism. Well actually so so in australia there's a much much bigger impact on on tourism not yet being back to to. The good old level. I think europe is in decent. Very helpful. Thank you ellen exclamation point. And yes just too very quick follow-up question one on the lab made diamond should we assume. It's launched in new markets in 2023. And the second question i just did reverse engineering you said. Call billion of inventors year and and. 30 weeks of saint. Assuming and unchanged gross margin that would imply 30 billion in revenue next year. Do you drive at the same number or where do i get it wrong thanks. On the lab credit number that's part of our i suppose our guidance conversation when we get to february so it it is a little bit early. To cover that point even though i know it's an interesting question of course. I let the arithmetics to under zone on. And and dear on the phone bill that you don't put a decimal on the number that we have provided out there so you. It doesn't have to be before 4.0 but when when we obviously when we sit on now november 8th and look at. A production for for the rest of the year we constantly looking into next year and and flex production of up and and down and we can do that with fairly short not. So always sort of steering towards anything out the year with. It might give and take a 30 weeks off of 30 weeks of car. I think the other all the things should have to take into consideration when you look at it is that the the weeks of cover is on the finished coach only which is. A decent part of the inventory but it's not all of the inventory it's have the the raw materials. At the point of sales material that that sits in those numbers so of course it it also plays into how we will translate the 4 billion into exactly what would that means. It's over in reverse engineering to. At revenue at revenue growth number so all translating into i'm not going to say something about revenue for next year yet but we just wanted to send the signal that that inventory will be much lower obviously that's that's not. Big magic about me much lower by the year by the. By the end of this year and then we are managing to watch a slightly higher weeks of coverage on the on. On the finished products which is a part of the inventory. Make make sense thank you very much. Thank you and this question comes from the line of martin brand new at nadia please go ahead to your line is open. Hi thank you and yeah i'll try to do it quick as well and just the first of all. Can you share any sort of fat. That's the date on how the loans trajectory look like for the diamond pattern was it more. Of a big bang in the first week or was it there slowly accelerating through the quarter of how did that look like and also just. In terms of the the q4 guns the implicit to four guys. Hey how should we think about the price volume makes the. There's because as i understand that the. A price hikes were not previously baked into the guidance. I'm so so does that interestingly mean that you're actually expect. Hey stop sent lower volumes in. Your father's previous expectations or just some color that would be great thank you. So on the launch trajectory what we've seen is i mean of course there was a bit of a hike the the one or two weeks when you launch. And then what we see is a slow sequential. Build up week by week as we kind of. You know. Just improve our execution as i mentioned at the bottom 80 stores if i can move them from being 2% your business to the average of. Well that average would obviously move if i move these. But then but we see kind of a slow slow build happening week in week out. That there was one exception when we when we ran a promotion we did not run a price promotion on the diamond. So then that you had a little bit of a. It's lower trajector that one or two but then it came straight back when when we were back to to kind of normal operation so i think that that's a positive sign of the business. And then on your question about asp increases and q4 i think you're right marching it when we go back to the original guidance earlier this year was that 5th 9 this year. And we had not some included there at general. Asp increase in the in the. In the guidance. Having said that we. That's a caveat to that and that is that we. Assumed that we would do price increases or price changes on. And the new product introductions that we doing during the year not on the existing products but on the on the new products. And then we had assumed that we will be doing. The price changes in more volatile economies like turkey argentina other countries with. Kind of hyperinflation like in environment so we're not but not the more broader price increase was must not reflected in there. We'll see how it plays out but i said exactly where. And and looking at quite a lot into making the price adjustments on products where we see it and we will see a decent price elasticity. But if you try to do the math then on. Just on the top of my head here if if we assume the price industry would be one then obviously revenue impact would be 0. But then it would translate into. Just about let's call it a hundred basis point of even marching once it's as full effect it won't have full effect in q4 yet but on a run rate basis that i price the decisity of one will give us around 100 basis points of. Ebit martin a christian. From the 4% asp increase. Talk more about it and in the. In early february when we come out with the q phone numbers obviously. Okay thank you so much anna congratulations again thank you. Thank you alan's question comes from the line all through gibson at abg please go ahead to online is open. Thanks so much morning alexander's i just have one question real quick and i'm sorry to come back on the current trading but since you've been giving us your assumptions on the us market before. It will be helpful to understand where you're heading there so. When you say. Heading towards the upper end of the guidance to start also mean last in the us which i suppose is your sort of best case scenario. I think we'll be hesitant to go into the by market q4. No comments about what we did put in in writing in the in the company announcement is that what when we started out the year we. Every putting the table to help you guide with fruits and how to think about the us and the rest of the world pandemic. Later on also the wall. And of course that became a range for for the us we gave a range for the rest of the world and obviously then as you. Go through the year and if you just try to take those ranges and then applied. Just about that does that implicitly mean for q4 you obviously get to some pretty crazy white wide ranges. And that that's what just why we called out that the lower end of the bad end of the of the range for us. Doesn't look very meaningful because it would that would require a significant deceleration. Indian q4 i think it's down to - 20%. Organic growth we need to get to to that and that that one is that's not in the cards. Definitely not in the car. That's the help. Thank you and we have one side question the cue that's from the line after this for horse or dws please go ahead your line is open. First how is your view and your visibility on the inventory levels well at your distribution channel partners and is there any difference. In the composition there because you talked about like you are. I mainly focusing. I run up products do you have any ability. Do you see any like benefit of down trading from higher income customers which are new to pandora i mean apart from like obviously the diamond collection but also for your core product. I don't fully understand the first question so i'll answer the other one and then we can think about whether we got the right question we do not see or let me put it like this we do not record. Down trading because we don't ask customers. If they you know. Instead of buying cashier they came to us that you know we'd be quite an offensive moment in the selling process where we kind of look at is the number of. New customers coming into the business which we can see when when a business grows it's partly a reflection of having enough inflow we have a higher inflow of of new customers then we have an outflow which kind of you always have this. In. My wedding where they come from we don't really and you know we don't have a continuous track on that then we would have to do a dipstick measure which you know maybe we should do a couple of months into next year we have never done that before but i would say that it's highly speculative i would love for them to do so. But i don't i don't i simply don't know. And and i forgot your other other question right then i can try to give an answer and then see if i actually answer the question but the inventory. We do have some visibility into the inventory among our partners is not as of online to the. Same extent in the same way in our own stores but obviously we do have some visibility and i think the shop messages that the. Inventory. Since we did the cleanup in 19th of sparta program now in montreal has been. A healthy and good at among our franchise partners. I think in general they're they're running with a little bit lower weeks of cover then then we are and then they have been. I've been doing that. And this is not a new thing but a little bit lower coverage. But that was a bit lower. Availability a little bit more out of stock than than what we are running. But in the bigger picture a healthy inventory. And. Forget to quite. Quite similar to what we have in our own concepts to us and the shopping shops. It's perfect that doesn't make lesson thank you. Thank you and esther according to know for the questions in the cure handbags wall speakers for the closing comments. Okay well first of all thank you everybody for joining the call as we said you know we're quite pleased with with q3. Now i'm entering the the last part of the race for the year so you know well stocked up plenty of good initiatives out there. So so let's see how it lands finally.
