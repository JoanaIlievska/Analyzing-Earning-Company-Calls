I would be to be segment. Continues on the school trajectory. You ever get. Is that 70% into. And we continue to see strong momentum in your clients. Yes jessica damage in front tv. Is it 8.8% of 22. And if it's likely below the letters of last year. Which is not driven by revenue makes effect. Uber traffic. Is that a negative 42.8 million euro. All button line was impacted by continued investments in strategic growth initiatives. And a cross structure based on growth expectations. And today we confirm our revised guidance for the full year 22-23. We are all aware of the volatile market environment and persisting uncertainties. Despite detect. We are confident. If we will grow our revenues by 10 to 20% over here. Fallout. We expect a few years. Up around a negative 140 million. 120 million euro. But no i'm checked the different drivers with observed into two. Environment. What happened intensified in the eurozone. Infection which require kind of. And consumer confidence is going to record low. Was sending these headlines. We continue to grow. Between your character of 41%. And the two you can't have 29%. Underline the resilience of all business model on a long term growth project. Yeah but you grow to make no expectations. And it's at 8.9% due to. Between the fact deep iteration and. Grand theft auto you want 222. If i'll take a closer look at the revenue drivers for our commerce business into 2223. Illustrated on this chart. In the year but you comparison versus q2 21 22. It becomes k. But our customer base remains health. Even if he's. What active customer grows remains below the levels of last years. We continue to be healthy increases in the number of return customers. And i'll continue growth investment. Both of you to a drug number of customers here. Also the other frequency for both recurring a new customers has further increase in q2. Despicable macro environment. Did you how ever see negative development in the area in the average order value. Thank you too. Pieces to autumn i slack it down your. Which is enforced by continued normalization and return rights. And despite the impression of the environment. We are observing a decline in the advertising price. This is driven by michael detectors. Frisbee and see how your discount. Second. Average i can practice. Due to the outperformance of market. Pretty mom to send it or going to blow a price points. Not. You're also seeing product. On the one hand he's demonstrating. Meeting some consumers are trading down. On the other hand. Because i also driven by the continued onboarding of fast fashion brand. If it's trying to pull up offering at entry price points. You could positive of this picture is that future growth prospects women. Do they growing and we're at the customer base. Even in between environment we saved into two. Western auto econom. However put pressure on. Turn top i'm talking about dynamics. On my pressure is intensified for the currently low demand letters. You are addressing this issue with my measures along our clock lines. I would like to give you some examples here. Done with. Which are negatively impacted by other imagery leverage. You better make supply with demand. You have to drop the ordering for the winter 22 and spring summer 23 season. You close collaboration with all suppliers. Wonderful feeling. The northern expected revenue. Pizza i need to graduation in our distribution and return centers. Economics optimization to keep focus area. To compensate for some of these effects. And we are testing several measures. If you're increasing share of office. And active capacity management we can improve utilization against the baseline. Marketing teams are in a particularly difficult place. Because they have to step it as revenue growth in a difficult market environment. Anything safe cost at the same time. Performance marketing. We decided for my unified and talking. Faster. In addition we are reducing fixed cost and content and media standings. General expenses are impacted by the currently lacking operating leverage. Consequently we are slowing down the number of new hires. And if all the federal intensified our overhead efficiency program addressing various cost class. It's not double click on the fulfillment cost on for a second. Well i'll talk to revenue ratio increase this proportionately. From 25% into 2 21 22. 228.5% in our future this year. This increases due to a mix of market and company specific factors. Fighting with market pictures. First. The increase inventory numbers. Residing from the weekend consumer demand. Metro higher discounts and the temporary increase in browsing and processing cost. This effect is expected to ease over time. If you ordering is adjusted for the upcoming season. Second. Logistics special conversationary dynam. Such a higher fuel and packaging cost. That's what it's waiting for this. Making it more difficult to meet at economies of scale. 50. Is expected the pursuit of the midter. As we expect inflation between next. 30 as expected. If she returned right moving back to what pre-covered level. An average auto value slightly down here. We expect these normalized return rate to persist for the long-term. Time to technological advances. Whatever more consistent positive impact on return rates. Let me know come to the company specific factors. I'd like to remind you first. If we are currently right in the middle of all europeans he never brought out. As indicated on the left hand side of this charge. Also breaking side as best we can be complete. Poland is not entering when bob in france is already in construction phase. The network rollout has significant implications on our current and future fulfillment construction. First. We are exposed to step crossing the road. And. Interested in. You need to completion. This effect with either time. Even i will continue growth expectations and active capacity management. Second. Create the number turn grand rapids. It's one time cause i'm not adjusted. And we're sustainable the midr. Under all four diseases are fully operating. Finally the increasing operation of complexity. Which is used for the growing number of entering pc. He's expected to purchase for the long term. Complexity cost arriving from. Can print it be offset if i take this like increase automation process improvements and operating leverage. But this will take time and it's in and it has not expected for the mature. The increase in 22 23. It's caused by a mix of temporary effect. Which are expected to either for the next quart. And structural effect. Which are expected to consist over a long time horizon. The revenue development for the tv segment overall it's currently volatile. On the one hand. The successful crossing of customers into other dvd product. My neighbors revenues from individual customers will be increased. On the other hand. Also all of you to be customers to their own online test adversity affected by micro factors. And i confronted with a strong compass from last year. This also negatively impacts the growth of all care take with revenues. If these are trying to be customer service. For the mall in decreasing spending would i. Can also be objectively customers more broadly. Interview of micro headwinds and recession expect. But aside from the starting rem. We continue to progress very well on the future value drivers for scale. This is demonstrated by strong your client was in recent month. Which are facilitated by the successful brand positioning of sc. The comfort volume that we acquired with new customers this year alone. It's up to 100 million rules over the contract. I'm proud to provide our software to when i'm play. Such a few amount of document. I'm trying to go there online business. Put all stock products in the future. At least one of our times it is important for us to be very clear also in our medium term prior. Number 14 for the group. Even an fy2324. We are aware. Did the break even targeting optimist. Against the current market that go up. And if you are continue growth investments and revised expectations for this year. But you will continue to evolve strongly over the next quarter. And then we will be in a good position. To deliver on our target next year. Let me send it to the. You have much larger and more active customer base than this year as we continue to see improved customer metrics even the changing environment. You haven't critical mass and now i'm not even southern market. Anything else to affect if you slow down investments in brand and you have my. Using the pressure on the gloss margar. You have a box and i'll let you never thought. And expect some of the current headlines on fulfillment cost to ease over the. You will have a higher self high margin soft revenue for scared as the newly acquired needs are progressing to live stage. And lastly. Google the effects from our running efficiency programs. Targeting all cost. That's not going to the financial update. On top line. Will we continue to see all our segments growing. Despite the difficult market environment into. But let's talk with the group trading on the left hand side of this chart. Everybody discuss. We grew our revenues by 8.9%. Which corres. Performer 31 million revenues. If you accept an improvement in the world. Compared if you want 22 23. What was so strong impact from the russia ukraine conflict. Did not material. Love you girls have mother looking slow down. Over the course of 2223. And remember. We went to the dark segment. The revenues increased by 4.7% in the second quarter. But development of revenue from the definition was too far. In austrian switzerland. We continue to grow stronger. The german market on the other hand were more difficult. Particularly due to the shop keep trying to consumer sentiment. The rest of your segment. Revenues were up 28.6% into. What a performance in the first quarter was to impacted by the russia ukraine conflict. Ge performance started to improve in may 2022. Buckland performance in the early segment for silver supported or lost their media on brandon campaigns. Especially in our comparative and southern europe. Moving onto our tv segment. Whatever news convert 17% the second quarter. Everybody just. We have two different dynamics here. On the one. I'll take my business is negatively impacted by the current revenue development of our clients. And we observe everybody that's also on the b2b side. On the other hand. Would you start fraction in the quiet with an integrating new client. And we are able to cross an existing science into other people. You're probably going to discussed our common problem drivers for q2. And the atm figures to pick up here for a similar picture. 27%. For the increase in frequency. And i never thought about you which declines towards pre-covid-19. That's number one to our bottom line which is currently under pressure in all our free business segments. But let's start again on the left hand side of this charge. Phone number. Add a negative 9.9% into 2223. First -3.3% in the last year. Imagine decline is primarily the result of field and expected revenue. The previously discontent cost. And contin. All about business women profitable despac. If you adjust the damages. You trying to open 4%. Compared to 3.9% last. This is particularly driven by the german market. And you're going to make a check on material. Moving on to our re segment or the address 18.8%. The main driver for the negative people are the ongoing investment. From cosmaculation in brand building in our new awarding and southern european. Be affected. By compared behind discount. And across from the road out of our european c network. Martini business to keep the q2 address of 8.8%. Down from 15.4% in the last year. If you turn into the margin can be explained by several fact. First. Security impact was dynamics of time out in south 19 reven. Which i tried to deliverance of all the baby. Secondly. Check or not implementation. Which will convert into high modern soccer and it's only in the mid. Until then he's projects are involved on a time of material basis. Which corresponding margin. Particularly in the state cont. Find restaurants are being made. Internationalization of the business. And a more practical to mark with olive garden salesforce. Block. We also seeing strong growth and comparing low margin to be revenue stream. Like fulfillment in full services. You create negative revenue mix effect. For the tv margin as a whole. If not take a look at the key costs of. Starting with a gross margin. So it's not improvement of 10 bakers point. 239 + 1592. Despite the changing market conditions. If development is primarily the result of the continued and trees in the shelf will be revenues. And in addition. Economies of scary without it from here agreement the suppliers and operational optimiz. Inspectors were able to offset pressure on growth profit. Of behind me to 11. Inflation that's my uncertainty and supply chain impact. Awful feeling. Which increased the 28.5% into two. Up from 20.3% of the previous year. This is the result of a mix of market sectors like inflation and return rate. And company specific sectors in the context of our dc network roll. Moving on to our marketing. Marketing customer 15.8% into. This is primarily the result for more conservative conservative steering. Performance already marketing channel. It's higher return on invest. Love. I want another customer. Despite a generally high level of inflation. That's all over that matt. Despite the changing market will we face into two. We are seeing a positive development in all cost lines except for the fulfillment cost. The extent of the fulfillment cost increase. It's all about driving a decrease of all the group address. By 616 +. Two negative 9.95,22. Our networking capital moves into positive territory. And is the 26.8 million euro fuck you too. But anyways. Go to the lower than expected revenue growth in h1. She's. At the beginning of the office of winter season that's what a structure in jesus tutorial obviously net profile. Our capex model for 10 million euro into two. Which is a moderate increase compared to the prior. And you. Most of the capex went into our growing our key in the district. But i first look at our free cash flow. What you got a negative 10 million fuck you too. The significant cash office inventory. It was the negative people drop for the quarter. Define cash flow is a negative 6.7 million euro. About payments for using ag. The end of the quarter with cash equival. Alternate 48 union. Very comfortable tax position. To never get to clean microwave. And to continue investments into the goals of the business. If not move on to the final section of the presentation. The financial out. We need to write our revised f-1223 guidance. As we expect our group. So we were at a capex which is expected to be around 60 to 80 million euro. And networking capital is expected to be neutral to what the end of fy223. As we are expecting elevated inventory level. Also in h2. I would like to finish this presentation by thinking you all for your time today. And i'm not looking forward to answering your questions. Somebody right now can we start. We have the first question from under critchler from society canada. Please go ahead. If i'm taking my question i've got two so first of all you mentioned the flexibility in autumn winter 22 23 orders in response to increased inventories now do you have any flexibility for spring summer 23. And then the second question is about rest of europe so just wondering which markets you think have greatest potential to be profitable longer term. And you intend to focus on these more and are there any markets which you'll kind of withdrawing. And if it's away from thank you. Yeah thanks for the question so on the on the other flexibility so for spring summer 23 there's definitely some flexibility and we are cooperating closely here with our suppliers. I think the the spring summer 23 will not be at an ideal spot but pretty close to and for our winter for industry then. This is pretty green field and we can completely adjust order to the current demand levels that we expect. For our. I think there's no particular market to be called out so we are we are actually quite positive about the profitability evolution of our ce markets. Now especially since they are recovering from the initial russia ukraine demand shock. We also positive about the development of the nordics although this is certainly still at an early stage. But looking at core behavior economics and so on. Pretty positive here. And this also has true for the last part of our new selling european market. You made a bit more of a mixed pictures to some markets not fully living up to expectations but probably speaking also here with super confident that this will break even. In the future. Thank you very much. The next question is. Georgina. Johanna from jp. Just go ahead. Hi i've got three quick questions. The first one was just with regards to their reconciliation amount in re. Stop stepped up quite a lot is that something to do with the higher returns. Is there something else going on there please. My second question was just with your reference to increase. Complexity in the fulfillment coastline. Are you only referring there to multiple ware. Or is there something else going on there please. And then finally just to. Patient and i'm sorry because i think. My line dropped off. The full way you then recom. In times of medium time targets in the 5 billion of revenue practice and answered question given the backdrop but just to understand are you now formally moving away from that target please or is it still kind of remaining there is a an ambition if you like. Thank you very much. Yeah sure so let's start with the question on a reconciliation one driver here is the strong increase in our fulfilled by about your revenues. Which are shown as revenues in the tme segment as part of the enabling revenue stream. And these are the reconciled on group level. And on in the in the office group statement are shown as a reduction in clock. This extends price of the of the highway consideration and then there's also a different. Different in the in the revenue recognition. And timing for the group accounts versus the segment account. And this explains some volatility. Which evens out over time so there's a bit of of a timing gap. Which explains also part of the highway consideration for the q2. On the next question with complexity and fulfillment yeah this fully relates to the higher number of dcs i mean we are. I'm building an integrated network here so we are optimizing the stock availability. Across the disease and it's not that we're using the disease for single market but rather try to make l. Part of the stock available to all markets and. This is of course quite complex and involves a lot of. Transportation in rooting optimization and so forth. Yeah this is the key driver of complexity that we are currently seeing and also expect for the future. And in terms of the medium-term target the 5 billion revenue goal. Yeah we still think that's achievable it has of course become more ambitious now given the current macro environment and so forth. But we still think it's achievable. That said let out in the presentation he focus presently is on the break even for the next financial year. And once with achieve that. We. Take it to us a look at the. Medium term revenues and bottle nine targets derived from that. Thank you i'm sorry just to be clear you still think 5:00 a.m. revenue is potentially achievable in fiscal 26. Great thank you very much. The next question comes from nicholas katsop. From bnpp ex. Please go ahead. Hi thank you for taking my questions and thank you for quite a comprehensive. Presentation. That you guys quite a lot of detail on the fulfillment costs but maybe focusing on the other hospital but. Are you brought down the marketing cost in admiral cost ratios. But quotes on quarter and you're on. Is this the kind of profile that we can expect you to maintain or target at least the going forward. And the rest of the year. And then on the marketing costs. You mentioned a high already higher roi threshold. But also brand building off could you give us a sentence. How much it was. Contributing to the to the lower rat. And then do you see any downward pressure on. Short performance marketing prices given the lack of demand in the water market. Thank you. Yeah of course let's start with. The evolution of the coastlines for the year so for the marketing into three i would expect. Just like increase the q2. Both an absolute and relative terms. That is driven by a campaigning activity that we're doing at the moment events like the about your passion week which we just told the big influencer campaigns like for example right now with bella hadid and so on so there's a lot of. Brand building activity here and also of course continued investments into new markets at southern europe in the nordics. And fuck you for i would expect marketing cost ratio to them decline again. As we are progressing on our part to profitability for the fy2324. And edmond cost i think broadly the same picture as. Sss for the q2. So a little bit of an operating leverage but but not too much maybe a slight improvement versus versus last year. For the different components in marketing so the. These are eye target this is actually. Quite dynamic they are being adjusted with regards to the current market environment that we see with regards to customer lifetime value expectations and so on. This is also making up the larger proportion of marketing spend. So here it's yeah it's volatile but it can be seared on ready short notice. And for more like 6 type marketing components so like big big branding campaigns or events or big insurance corporations. This is definitely the last time then 50% and this is also. One key focus area where we look at when we talk about marketing cost savings. For the future given that markets are maturing and we see our brand. I also well established also in in your markets. And in terms of the the dynamics that we see on the on the cost per x. I would say cost for also performance oriented marketing channel. I'm coming down so there's less marketing pressure and this also needs to lower cost per. Click or leave. But this is also in line with a customer lifetime value projections coming down so. Due to the unit economics. And that we discussed and also. A customer behavior on general. It is also that the tv projections are being red. So this is going hand in hand and it doesn't give us a particular. Advantage. Thank you that is very care. The next question is from midlandizer from deutsche. Please go ahead. Thank you i have three as well the first questions on your third party sort of suppliers. How deep acting at the moment are they increasing prices because of their own cost pressures and has that been sort of easy to pass on to your own customer base how are you sort of approach that development. Some color there would be great. Second of the statement in the press release i think made by patrick where he said this is a time to focus on profitability of a short-term growth and we expect a period of market consolidation could you give us some color as to what the market consolidation angle implies is it from the the online marketplaces perspective or more from the supply perspective some color there would be great. And my last question is on the outlook for the full year i'm reaching the midpoint does imply that grow. Food accelerating h2 and profitability on absolute numbers could improve as well. Is that a reasonable assumption with everything you're seeing at the moment. Thank you. Yeah thanks for the questions let's start with the one on third party suppliers. So rrps are. Developing in line with what we had expected i think so we we were expecting mid to. High senior digit increases for automotive 2022 that is also what we are seeing. Given the elevatory situation that we're seeing right now and the. Yeah i i discount things. I think we are not able to fully pass this on to to customers. But i would expect us to be able to do so. Once supply in general is better and sync with demand. And then on the on the second question in terms of market consolidation yeah it's a general statement i mean if we look at the at the online fashion market. And see the the share of the market owned by big platforms that's that's probably. The third also. And we will expect this share to increase over time. This is a consistent with the assumptions also prior to all these. Change it in the micro environment. But maybe we will see an acceleration of that happening now. In in the. And the last question on outlook for the for the full year yeah we're comfortable with the with the growth assumption 10 to 20% for the full year. I said it implies it's not acceleration it grows versus our. Mq. But we also facing. Softer. How far it's too from last year. So we're confident here and this is also. A back by the current trading that we're seeing. And in terms of profitability you're right we expecting a slight improvement in the margin versus the h1. But this is also in large pot extent but season. Hector so we are seeing a higher profitability pattern in h2 versus h1 due to higher ticket items return rates and so on. And also of cost you to some of the positive effects that we already see in h2 from the efficiency measures. That we're not executing. Especially in view of the break even target next year. Great very helpful thank you. The next question is. Volca butterbank please go ahead. I'm going to come back on vacation. Reg. Doesn't find any mean. Going. And with. Woodford or. Awesome. Image and damage is going to stop according to sonic and. How to season 19. What's the temperature to take you. Against. And finally arkansas. Germany doesn't help you. Stupid girls have the pictures. Yeah thanks i must say i had a hard time understanding you so i think the first one was on. Consolidating trends again and impact on competition. Let me let me elaborate on this and then if i miss some of the aspects then please follow up on that. I. Expect. Competition. To be less intense in the course of this. Consolidation however this this would be my view. To be expected more like over the next. You're so really like a long-term horizon. And not that we're seeing. Or expecting something that you realizing in the very in the very short run. I'm so these consolidation trends at least all of you is stay with materials over over the years. And this is a long-term trend. And on on current trading yeah we've seen now an acceleration it grows in september versus versus august. That said august was also particularly soft so average growth in august was. Below average cost for the q2. And for coming from a little bit but i think generally the the gross parent has improved now moving into into our winter. Apartment conversation pro. No we're not planning to take an active part at this point we believe we have very strong organic growth opportunities ahead of us. And it's not that we are focusing on on like horizontal. Consideration we of course looking in terms of m&a at target. That are for example interesting for our technology. A product suites and or equihiring opportunities but we're not we're not driving. Horizontal consideration. And in terms of of taking private yeah this is this is not that we can comment on this would probably have to be asked. I'll show. But but we're not aware of any such plans. Ladies and gentlemen as a reminder you should wish to ask a question please press star followed by one. On your telephone. The next question comes from emily johnson from bar. Please go ahead. Morning and so my first question is on current trading into september october. Particularly interested in germany. You reference. Current trading with encouraging that you could see an acceleration into the second half of the year. How much of. The september october improvement do you think is a catch up effects from a particularly week august with the heatwave. Versus consumer demand starting to improve on an underlying basis. My second question is on the returns right and can you just clarify. Is not increasing the return to it just a product. Effect or. And it's returning to prepandemic levels or is there any kind of overshooting versus what you would have otherwise expected happening. I'm i'm in the third question is you referenc. While you were discussing the lower selling prices in the quarter. But can you give a bit more color on what you're seeing around consumers trading drawing and link to that what are your expectations for black friday and cyber week this year are you expecting it to be particularly promotional. Sure so on current trading catch up versus trend so what we've seen is i would say a delayed start into the autumn winter season. Given the the weather pattern that you described. So i think yeah. What we're seeing now is ramp up into into autumn winter which is a user path but it's just a couple of weeks delayed. But i think. It's too early to say that we're talking about a reversal or improvement in the. In the in the customer behavior. And this is also i think i mean it wouldn't be back by by the macro data that we have. So i think it's more like a short-term effect going to into autumn winter. And on the return rate so for the for the group as a whole we are seeing. Decline of the return rate that is driven by especially country mixed effects or lower return countries than growing faster than more mature ones. And on a on a like for like basis so same same country same product categories and consumer demographic price point and so forth. I would say return rates are almost back to pre-pandemic levels. But still slightly below so there's a very small margin. Where our expectation however would be that this will also. And this will also sees so we will get completely back to pre-pandemic levels over time. And on the selling prices yeah we we do see some consumer segments trading down. This is probably however also partly induced by the supply side so generally more more discounting and also. At least for fast accelerated onboarding of also fast-pression brands and so forth. And yeah it's a good question with regards to black friday we also asking this ourselves. Yeah i think there could be there could be. Some positives here given given the current consumer behavior. Oh that said however over the last years we had observed more. Yeah less of a hype around black friday and which which of these dynamics were without to be stronger this year how to how to say at this point to. Ms johnson there's that clear your question. Thanks very much. The next question is from simon bola for. Please go ahead. Hi good morning i'm just two questions for myself is okay first one being i'm just on your dc network rollouts. Just is there a kind of much flexibility around that if you wanted kind of rain back some of your ambitions there with regards to. Of the french location in particular i guess or even options around subletting or finding alternate use. You've taken on. I'm in secondly was. I'm just to what extent you are or all considering any kind of changes to for example you kind of delivery returns proposition as a lever to support. To drive towards. Yeah sure so under on the network of the singer dc's i mean there's always a bit of flexibility because usually these are being built. Happy modularly so you can scale these facilities also up over time. Which is it which is. Common procedure i think and this is also what we plan to do and had also plan to do prior. To the current market environment. I i'm actually pretty positive that over the. The quarters and years the size of capacity that we are crying with a new disease. Would also match. The demand that we're seeing. So i i also wouldn't see a big need at this point. To really. Adjust the capacity that we have planned. And on the delivery and returns proposition yeah this is this is something that we're looking at and it's also what we mean with some tests around unit economics. Measures. We are we are testing around shipment cost/movies for example but it's too early at this point to really call out specific measures. For the for the meeting long run we are we are looking at this but more like in a testing environment right now and not yet fully wrote out in life. Great thank you. But this last remark will be ending the q&a. Frank bowman will address you with the final. Frank please go ahead. Get me close all presentation by saying thank you for all your support and for joining us today on our conference call for the second quarter. If there are any further. Please feel free to contact the ir team direct. Thanks and bye-bye.
