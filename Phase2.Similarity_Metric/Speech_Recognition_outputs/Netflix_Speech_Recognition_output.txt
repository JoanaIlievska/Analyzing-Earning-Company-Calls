Good afternoon and welcome to the netflix q4 2022 earnings interview i'm spencer wong vp of finance ir in corporate development. Joining me today are executive chairman read hastings co ceos test sarandos and greg peters. And cfo spends new. Are interviewer this quarter is jessica reef ehrlich from bank of america. As a reminder will be making forward looking statements and actual results may vary. But that jessica over to you for your first question. Thank you and thank you so much for having me today. South ridge the big announcement about the management changes could you give us some more color on the process and how you came to this decision. You know jessica it feels like yesterday was our ipo we were covered in red envelopes. We ipod at about a dollar hopefully some of you have held the stock the full 21 years. And when i think of the evolution the three of us and and so many other incredible netflix. Employees. To go from dvd service to streaming leader in films and television. An emerging player in games and now to have over 230 million members. It's just. Jim collins probably said it. He called it a good start. We've had a good start. But you know honestly we dream of the whole world finding their favorite entertainment on netflix. And we short had that as entertaining the world. And the three of us have been working together for 15 years now trying to figure out how do we get through this issue that issue how do we grow. And i couldn't be happier to complete our succession process. It really started about 10 years ago with the board trying to think through how could this work they both have such amazing talents and gifts. And to find a platform where they've been able to contribute is is fantastic. About two and a half years ago we took a partial step. Ted is co ceo greg a c o o. We continue to just make super progress and yeah frankly more and more they've been leaving the company. And this is acknowledging really informal terms. Well how we been operating you know for at least the last few quarters. You know it's just a great feeling. And when i think about the stock appreciation over the last decade i know that they want to beat that record. And i'm all for that i'll be executive chairman helping them everywhere i can. But it's really theirs to lead and and to do that energy and hustle and intensity that we've been doing. They're very ready that's why it's driving the timing and so i could not be happier. So back over to you. Thank you subjectively i'll just add that this may be the smoothest transition. We've seen a media for quite a while. Now if it's heading and greg what is this mean for netflix does this signal a change in strategy or approach. Jessica let me start with the first and foremost to thank reed personally and professionally. He has been and i trust will continue to be you know role model a mentor friend. And 22 plus years reed has positively changed my life in every way imaginable. And he leaves some big shoes for greg and i to fill unfortunately we have four feet to do it with so that's a good thing. And so many ways the way that reads been able to see around corners that's why he's been thinking about the succession for the last decade. Generously. Opened up more of a co-leadership model over a decade ago for the for he and i and nikki said two and a half years ago made it a little more formal and in that time delegating a lot of the day-to-day to greg. And in that time no two and a half years we've been working at we've been working together for 15 years greg and. But in the last two and a half years particularly you know we've been able to build a really trusting respectful and complimentary partnership. In many ways the same way i would breed over the years. And i really do believe that this kind of share leadership model is going to help us to move fast and to challenge each other to challenge the company to raise the new heights. And i'm just incredible but we're able to do it to your point this is the leadership team it's been pretty stable and that's why that. Steady transition feel so steady. Disability this team has helped us build a great foundation and a culture that can absorb complexity and change. And as you saw in this last quarter can rise to any occasion. And greg i just want to say i'm i'm thrilled to be in this with you and read we can't thank you enough. Thanks ted it's real honored to be asked to take on this responsibility and enjoying you as coco and. And frankly a pleasure to be able to continue to working with some of the most amazing leaders that i've ever had the pleasure of working with and and frankly my opinion the best leadership team in the netflix has ever had so. I'll just echo ted's comments it's been a real fun and rewarding experience to work closely with him over the last. Couple years especially and i'm tremendously proud of the partnership that we've developed in the shorthand. And really how we have been able to take you know what are sort of a complimentary set of skills and perspectives and seeing different angles. The different situations but basically you know at the end of the day we are i've always found our ultimately motivated by the same things which is that we want to serve our members and we want to grow our business and that. Credible and powerful lining process to those different perspective so. I'm proud of the work that we've done over 22 in the latter half especially to get some more momentum into the business but i'm even more excited about. I'm continuing to push that into 23 and follow you know the model that reed is always had of you know continually. Seeking excellence and always driving to be better so looking forward to that and then to your specific question jessica you know we there's no big strategy shift or big culture shifts you know ted reed and i have been working and sort of grinding through our individual perspectives on this for a long time. And so really we look forward to taking things forward as we have been for the last little bit and responding to a dynamic industry and doing the changes that we think are appropriate but we're not we don't have a bank of changes that were that we've been holding for this moment so mostly it's continuity and move forward. Great. This was originally for read but now i'd give it the the. Leadership structure maybe for all three of you for read ted and and greg. One of the best quotes recently was from john malone who said shareholder should build a monument. For read hastings. The dominant global media companies and prior decades. And we're one of the few media executives who've been able to see around corners. Ultimately they both sold the bulk of their assets. Netflix is now one of the most dominant. Global media companies if not the domin. What is your view of the next 5 plus years do you need to get bigger. Stay the course. Well the one thing i point out is that what's happening now and what's going to be happening over the next couple of years is that the consumer is moving to streaming. So the way that they watch content at home delivered to them on internet on demand of free of the linear schedule and all those things that is a change a fundamental shift in the business and you've got to be where the consumer is and that's what we've been focused on since we started streaming 10 doing original content 10 years ago but being really realizing that we really have benefited from being a customer first company. And meeting the customers where they are and we've also had this blessing of not having to unwind our traditional media business as we built into this one. So we've always been focused on the future and where the consumers are going and i think our ability to continue to stay focused on that cuz we're this is really i know as we were talking about it for a long time jessica but this is really at its infancy. I mean you think about as big as we've become and all these things that are happening and in the us we're about 8% of tv time still. So it's an enormous amount of growth ahead and even in markets where we are very well established so that's the key for us and i think being able to focus on consumers first. And is bit really been our biggest benefit and i think it's what led us to those milestones you just referred to right. Yeah and just got to say i think that that translates into being bigger and i think that means being bigger in terms of touching more. Members around the world delivering them incredible entertainment we'll see that in terms of being bigger in terms of the amount of engagement that we can drive the amount of you know hours that were satisfying them i'd be bigger in terms of the culture and practice too i mean you've seen you know i mean. Credible. Cultural impact in terms of wednesday stranger things that the ramifications that the shows have in terms of the popular culture are significant and that's going to get bigger too also means bigger in terms of revenue and profit stream so we're looking forward to those as well. So losing subs in 2022 in the market reaction. Or evaluation reset is akin to august 2015 when bob iger called out the early decline of pay tv sub. And the impact for disney's espn. It will take a while for disney to build espn plus into a sports streaming giant. And actually they may never replace the profitability of espn at that point in time. You're pivot seems more broad-based by extending genres and going to new areas whether it's games fitness live etc. Do you see any similarities or differences to that. Momentous inflection point. But you know what you certainly shifted wall street view from subs to profits. I'll take a shot of that in 10 maybe win but i think it's a fundamentally different situation and if you look at where we're at. A significant part of what we need to go do is essentially take the core model that we've been operating you know since we've been starting and streaming and just execute it. Better in all. And so you know whether it's you know the incredible content that bella and scott's teams are are producing constantly how we're talking about that content to the marketing and conversation that we do the product experiences and business model innovations that we're doing but a lot of it really fundamentally is about executing that core model better we're not and there's not a lot of. You know massive pivots away from a traditional legacy business model that we have to go figure out we're planning some seeds you know in terms of games and things like that that you know if we execute well and we're excited about the progress we're seeing so far will represent you know the the you know future potential for us in terms of growth and more profit opportunities so that's exciting but essentially a lot of this is just you know continue to execute the play that we've got and do it better and better. And then i don't know about the similarities but i would say that this business is really completely about. Engagement profit and re. So we got to grow all of those things and all those things are really our tied to executing on that gun the content when the contents working the business is working. The grow engagement we grow revenue we grow prof. There's an interesting thing you know starting in july. And you think about from. Stranger things season 4 from the phenomena that became. And what we've been able to offer up to our members from that day forward so they went from stranger things to extraordinary attorney wu which is was a phenomenal success in throughout asia and south korea but also i build a big cult fan base in the us. Straight into cbs which is our biggest animated film ever straight into purple hearts engram and two of our most watched films ever on netflix. And then to august the sandman and never have i ever season 3 september cobra kai season 5. Empress cyberpunk is this animated adaptation of a video game that's been held as one of the greatest of all time narcos said another monster hit from north from north korea the jeffrey dahmer story monster. Straight into watchers of back-to-back kids from ryan murphy all quiet on the western front was just today became the most nominated non english film in the history of aftas only gandhi has gotten more more nominations in the history of the baptist. And that's from germany with the great ed burger and then straight out of there into enola homes too a big monster success sequel to with with billy bobby brown. And you look at all these things that go back and forth and they go all the way into january now we will end the month with you people eddie murphy and jonah hill any any outlet would kill to have any one of those months as their entire year. And it's our ability to fire on those cylinders and create hits but more than that create the expectation that as soon as you're done with this one there's another one waiting for you. I just think the analogy is kind of fundamentally different so with espn and the example you gave that that was a fundamental kind of shift in the industry from you know 100 plus million pay tv connected homes to cord cutting that's on a path down to you mid to high single digit reductions in that distribution platform each year and that's in moving in that direction so it's kind of a shrinking you know core distribution platform where you see in our earnings letter the world. Even in the largest if there there is no country where streaming is more than 40% of share of tv time and in many big countries as you saw it's less than 5%. So it's our five work less than 5% it's less than 10% so. It there's an incredible runway still in the shift. From linear to streaming and so for us it's about growing into that shift and also obviously competing well and continuously innovating and improving and what you saw or what we saw and felt. When we had that decline in in subscribers was really near-term limit. In growing into that big market but the big market is still growing as opposed to fundamentally long-term limiters. And espn shift that you you described. Let's move on to some of the the drivers of growth both near and medium term. And start with advertising so your advertising platform's been open only two months. And you amazingly giving somebody back to advertisers indicating in one way that demands is exceeding supply. The company is us consistently said you're going to crawl walk and run. How is the pro stage going relative to your expect. Yeah like you say it's two months and i think the the hardest part is actually that first step when you're crawling because you don't really you know know what exactly to expect. As you get it going and now you know with two months. Yeah we're. Ridiculously early but we yeah we've learned a bunch already i would say so you know just ticking through this i'm at the first and foremost is that we were able to launch. This very very quickly and you know the tech is all working the product experience is good and that's really testament to lots of hard work. On for both microsoft and netflix teams who you know who work very hard to make that happen and it's really rewarding to that to see. The other lights a pretty significantly fundamental thing is around engagement and we see that engagement from ads plans users. Is comparable to sort of similar users on our non. So that's really a promising indication means we're delivering. A solid experience and it's better than we model then that's a you know a great sort of fundamental starting point for us to work with. Furthermore now we're seeing take rate and growth on that ads plan is solid. Great because partly that take raid and that grow. Is due to incremental subscribers coming into the service because we have a lower price point that's $6.99 in the us. $4.99 euros in germany just give you two examples and so that elasticity is a real you know not only a benefit to sort of growing our ad scale and sustainability but also to the general business. I expect to see that continue to actually grow over the year not take rate you know fits sort of within the. The middle of our other plans which is another really healthy sign it means that we've got a complimentary set of offerings. That are working to sort of satisfy different needs for different consumers at the right mix of features and price points that's quite good. Another important one i think for the investor community because it came up a lot before we launched was. Plan switching we aren't seeing as expected you know much switching from high arm subscription plans like premium into our ads plan so the unit economics remain very good as we model so these are all you know really good initial sort of progress points but i think it's you know important to reiterate that you know as you mentioned you know we're crawling and we'd like to get to to sort of you know move to the walking phase we got a lot to do to get there. So there's a bunch of technical improvements in terms of you know. Add delivery validation measurement we've got progress already on that more to do in the next quarter or two. Are getting improvements which will be better for consumers more relevant advertising better for advertisers in terms of more you know value delivered a better set of offerings. I'm product for advertisers to buy. The long list of experience improvements that. We know we can deliver the to live more value to both subscribers and advertisers. And there's this also some nuts and bolt stuff that we are learning and improving just things like. How do we you know do a better job with microsoft at the ad sales and operations processes are so much that we need to do both. Companies need to do to better serve advertisers serve an increasing number of advertisers and and meet that demand so we're just getting started we're constantly improving and we see the trajectory ahead of us and really our aspirations are. You know ultimately successively over a period of years to basically. Bill just like we have you know essentially in terms of the streaming experience. You know the the best most effective highest quality premium connected tv ads experience. As a win for consumers and advertisers are not for us as a business. Expensive greg sorry jessica maybe give a little context on hulu. I'm kind of you know what we know about hulu's advertising they've had it in your head start. And sort of you know how many years will it take us to sort. Pass them in all of these key dynamics. You want to go first or you want. No i had already. All right. Let's see i mean hulu it's it yes they've had a long head start they started in the ads business they have you know we would estimate reason we obviously don't know exactly but. Roughly half of their membership is on the ads tear it's a you know a multi-billion dollar business for them already and. A domestic business us only so lower reach lower engagement than us. So you know you know that i guess the the short story there is we have given what we've seen and what what greg just outlined in terms of the engagement on our ad plan the strength of you know the the. The the performance in terms of the the monetization kind of unit economics and our ability to kind of scale in a in a way that is. Even better than the kind of comparable ad-free plan plus providing. Clearly choice that our members are consumers. On our are seeking out because of the the sign up flow that we would expect to be you know as large or larger over time certainly in just our us market and more from there but it's a it's a i just want to emphasize it's a multi-year path so we're not going to be larger than hulu and year one. But hopefully over the next several years we can be at least as large and we wouldn't be getting into this business obviously read it as you know if it couldn't be a meaningful portion of our business so we're you know we're over 30 billion of revenue 30 almost $32 billion of revenue in 2022 and you know we wouldn't get into a business like this if we didn't believe it could be bigger than you know at least 10% of our revenue and hopefully much more over time in that mix as we grow so that's that's kind of how i see it without putting a specific guide on it. You committed to an upfront market spot taking cbs's prior spa cbs now paramount spot. Which really indicates your long-term advertising goals of being a major advertising platform. Giveness is a prime spot on a critical week for advertisers in premium video like it's. It is it's amazing how quickly you just took that slot away. What's the run stage and how would you. What's the time frame to get there. But i think it's spence talked about it you know it it will be neuterative process to your point it does signal. Big aspirations here and we think there's a big potential opportunity and so. You know we're committed to incrementally execute against that opportunity but you know just back to spence's point we are starting from a you know a zero-based essentially. And also we're all starting from the history whereas a non adds platform we had a lot of folks who basically join netflix. You know fully as you know non-ad subscribers and so i think you know that that will be working through that over period of time. But again you know our our goal and aspiration is that this is a. Very meaningful and significant source of revenue and profit for us over many years to come. When you think about the pool of money that you're targeting you know linear let's call it 50 60 billion dollar business seems to eat like the easy money yours you've mentioned already views are shifting from streaming you know to streaming from from linear. Obviously you've seen all of the kind of eyeballs move. And and so now you have. We are basically more scalable r. But the digital pool is much larger. But in the past you said you've made comments the companies make comments that you can't compete with google and met. It would be incredibly difficult to compete with them. Has this changed has your view changed. Not really i would say that you know initially we are we're competing mostly with that sort of traditional you know tb advertising pool. Now i think we can layer into that over time. Components of what has made digital advertising so effective so you think about the targeting capability the fact that we're 100% signed in. I'm fully addressable if you think about the growing relevance of first party data and how we do that those are real you know big advantages that we can bring relative certainly to the the traditional tv world. But again the the form that we have at least you know for the next couple of years. We'll still be in that sort of lean back primarily in that lean back experience and so. That you know lends itself to certain kinds of advertising a certain kinds of advertising goal and a lot of the demand collection component that you know a google or a facebook is really good at you know we won't be well suited. Compete with that for at least some time to come. And jessica just add to that you know the good news as you saw in the letter is that. That branded video ad market. I greg talked about his focusing on is about 180 billion globally extra china and russia so we have plenty to do and you know a lot of opportunity just in that area alone. Yeah not today enormous opportunity but there's also. Besides advertising. An enormous opportunity in incremental subscribers as you you have mentioned. You're the lowest price service at least that we are the lowest price ever can you frame the opportunity in terms of subgrowth. Are you thinking about it sure and just a comment on on lowest price i mean again we don't really think about the pricing question from a competitive perspective. You know again we're we're you know think of ourselves as a non you know substitute or good you know when you you know when you think about wednesday or you think about class on you and these are titles you can only see on netflix that's extremely powerful you know scott and bella are delivering more incredible titles that are that are non-substitutable in that regard so really we think about the pricing. Question is how do we. Offer a wide range of options for a wide range of consumer needs we want to make that spectrum even wider as we seek to serve more you know members. Are around the world and trying to deliver you know appropriate value at those different price points and we're doing a good job expanding that range. And so then you think about you know so there's two pools then of incremental subscribers there's a bunch of you know people around the world and countries where you know we're not deeply penetrated and we have more opportunity to go attract them. A component of that is we've got folks that are watching netflix who aren't paying us as part of basically barring somebody else's credentials and you know our goal is over this year to to basically work through that situation and convert many of those folks to be paid accounts or to have the account owner pay. You know for them to get enough prescription but either way you know we're seeking to sort of monetize the viewing value that we're delivering. And then beyond that you know it's back to spence's comment. Yeah even our most penetrated market were 8%. Of your total tv time which is a potentially a relatively narrow lens to think about the broad competitive entertainment offering. So we have. Huge opportunity to grow the engagement component of that several. You know we feel like we can get to if we do a great job of executing a cross all fronts and that represents a tremendous. You know opportunity for more entertainment value delivered and we believe that the revenue you know flows from that in time. Before we get to pass return just one last advertising question. You now have roughly a decade of producing your own ip. Any thoughts on offering a fast service over time for advertising support. Television. Said you want to take this one. That look where we're open to all these different models that are out there right now but we've got a lot on our plate this year both with the paid sharing in with the launch of advertising and continuing to this slate of content that we're trying to drive to our members so we are keeping eye on that on that segment. For sure. So on the password sharing what will drive consumers to pay three or four dollars for sharing. Versus becoming a sub with their own profile. Is it affordability is there something else what do you expect. Yeah i think there's a range of motivations for for different borrowers so yeah some of it is economically driven and so part of a you know what we're trying to do is make sure that we are being responsive to that and finding the right price points whether in terms of a individual account or you know an extra member for it and obviously you know the the ad supported plans give us the opportunity to present. A lower consumer face pricing in those countries where we have advertising. Part of it's just when we call casual sharing which is you know people could pay but you know they don't need to and so they're borrowing somebody's account and so our job is to give them a little bit of a nudge. And to. Features that make transitioning to their own account. Easy and simple as we have this basically you know profile export feature which allows you to take your viewing history and all the great recommendations with you so you know to your point there's a range of motivations and i think a range of solutions that will be able to offer to land people in different places. Can you provide any details including the time frame for converting borrowers to paying accounts. Yeah so you know we've been working hard at this and and trying to do some some sort of thoughtful experimentation let our members really speak to us in terms of what set of solutions. Work for them so that's the testing that you've seen us do over the last couple quarters. We feel like we have gotten to a good set of features it's the the profile export that i mentioned but there's also a bunch of account management features that we think are important to making this experience work. For fol. And so we're ready to roll those out later this quarter we'll stagger that a bit you know as we work sort of work through sets of countries. But will really see that happen over the next couple of quarters and. Yeah i think it's worth noting that this will not be a universally popular move so there will be current members that are unhappy with this move will see a bit of a cancel reaction to that. We think of this as you know similar to what we see when we raise prices you know so we get some. Some increased churn associated with that for a period of time. But then generally what happens is you're both from the you know the specific. Changes that we make will see fol. Come on as new subscribers essentially borrowers creating their accounts or incremental monetization through the extra member that will happen shortly thereafter and then clearly our job is to continue to grow value. Right to have more amazing titles that people cannot wait to see and so whether that's. Satisfying those members you know who to make those transitions or you know winning back essentially folks who have turned off the service and bring them back on the service over the months and years to come. Jessica. Sorry i just made maybe just cuz what we touch on a little bit of the letter but just to kind of reinforce a little bit of what that looks like in terms of timing and guidance so. Those dynamics that greg just walked through because of that as we kind of. Start to roll this out later in q1 based on the timing when we talked about is that yeah we'll have modest growth we expect and pay that ads in q1. But i'll kind of atypical seasonality where typically q2 would be a softer pain and add quarter it'll probably be a larger paid in an quarter and most importantly or most focused on is obviously revenue that is our primary primary metric. And what you see is in the guide. These revenue initiatives between paid sharing. I'm rolling out and then scaling ads. You don't see much of that in q1 which is why we're forecasting 8% growth fx neutral in q1 revenue but throughout the course of the year we would expect to see accelerating revenue growth as. We roll out the page sharing you know broadly across our our business and then obviously scale ads throughout the year which is a more gradual bill so i just want to. To highlight that and that's kind of what you're seeing in the in the in the guidance. And given the revenue drivers of paid sharing and advertising. Are you thinking about price increases in the current year it's just too complicated how are you thinking about. Well i would say that the two initiatives that you described represent the bulk of our pricing strategy in 23 you know there we anticipated they'll both be you know revenue positive revenue agreed of significantly so in the in the you know according to details that spence just offered. Now you know having said that you know our core sort of pricing approach and theory remains the same and so we're going to look you know at the metrics you know that our members are giving us and telling us and look for opportunities where we. Yeah i think we done a good job at creating more value for them and you know for a certain you know customer segment in a certain tier and a certain country we think we've you know done a good job at delivering more entertainment for them and. Then you know we'll go back and you know opportunistically ask for them to pay a little bit more so that we can sort of keep this. Your virtuous cycle going and really invest that back into incredible content. I'm in stories and maybe ted i don't know if you want to highlight anything that you see coming on that side. No i just say that you know that's the messiness of the content that will make the paid sharing initiative work it's that will make the advertising launch work that will make continuing to grow revenue work. And so it's the cross film across television it's the content that people must see and that it's on netflix gives us the ability to do that. I'm super proud of the team and their ability to keep delivering on that in a month and a month out and quarter and quarter out and continue to grow and all these different market segments that are consumers really care about. So that to me is court to all these initiatives working and we've got to we've got the wind at our back on that. Right now. You amazingly continue to expand the genres of content. Which as you guys mentioned clearly drives engagement but the most recent new genre would you introduced on your platform and you know at the end of last very end of last month is fitness. There there you know simple but deceivingly effective. If you talk about what your plans are in this area and. You. Because you develop more content it really as i said drives value for anyone who would work out anywhere else. So how do you define success. Is there anything you can say about you know partner economics with nike. Yep okay coming to the parking economics but i would tell you that we've historically stayed away from the fitness category cuz it's abundantly available online in many cases for free as you know. But we thought if we could partner with a great brand and nike certainly a leading brandon fitness. I would really well produced content which this content is. And then let's go out to our members and see if it's something that they value and we'll see that in the engagement and see where they where we can take it from there. So i think in that way you know get working with a great partner in the high quality to your point of the of the content itself you know we'll put it a really good test to do people want to use netflix to get back to get in shape or to get back in shape. And if they do would like to keep serving that and if they don't we'll keep poking around so it's the way we kind of. We were able to test the market at the very high end with a premium brand partner. This constant speculation that you will experiment with sports which is an expensive. Rental business you know for for many. Does having an advertising offering change your views and offering sports. Any thoughts that you know on like wwe which is for sale that could be potentially. I'm just think that could be owned content like any views on sports i'd say you know sports are positions been the same which is you know we really we're not anti-sports for prophets and we've not been able to figure out how to deliver profits in renting big league sports in our subscription model. Not to say that that won't change would be open to it but that's where it's at today and wwe we look at you know we have a lot of m&a activity all the time we look at all of them but nothing we can comment. Just turn play a role in your investments into the live events. You know what life comedy special seem to have a value outside of the live window. Other events like you just announced that you're going to you know host the sag awards. I'm sports obviously you know these have fairly short useful lives. So how do you balance the investment in live versus the potential to drive. I would look at this as part of just like a other crawl walk run scenarios where we are really looking at our content that would benefit creatively from being live. So the results show for one of our competition series that we have or a reunion show that that drives news or like the sag awards and opportunity to engage audiences live and because we've got the shelf space. We can go do hours of shoulder programming around the live event and all those things that our members may enjoy. So thank you there's nothing particularly novel about live television as you know but we are dabbling in it starting with our chris rock live concert to try to create the excitement around live for those things that are uniquely more exciting to be live. The theatrical release of glasson was incredibly successful and. Limited release but so you know for some it looks like you left a lot of money on the table by not continuing beyond the first that one week. Giovanni regrets or you know can you give us your thoughts on your evolving phone strategy. Well but trouble i'm thrilled with every aspect of the release of glass onion you know starting with ryan johnson and his great film and. Scott steuben the film team for bringing it to the table and and i think what you saw was a lot of excitement we drove a ton of buzz with that theatrical release and we created a bunch of demand. And that demand we fulfilled on our subscription service are our core business is making movies for our members to watch on netflix. And that's what really focused and everything else is really a tactic to drive excitement and. Around those films. So you have like a massive global hit like a like a wednesday. Give this thing to be somebody ways you could drive monetization. I i know like for just staying with much for a second like like. The wednesday makeup was sold out in every mac store in new york city you could not buy it anywhere. Do you participate this time types of consumer products or is it just a way to. Your fuel balance you know fuel engagement. It's a little bit mostly the fuel engagement and fuel fandom we actually we do participate in it our own content we do drive a lot of revenue in our consumer products business but mostly the motivation is that is to drive fandom. And greg alluded to this earlier but this impact on the culture that this content can have on our platform. In our newsletter we mentioned the lady gaga song that you know came back after 11 years because of wednesday but that you know doesn't mention the four songs this year that we actually jam back into the charts some that never charted and something went off the charts for 40 years from metallica kate bush the cramps. And that impact on culture a sofia carson's music career took off because of purple hearts. Virginia jenny orton picked up. Generator picked up 10 million social media followers in the first week wednesday launched on netflix. And all these folks who build this gigantic careers on netflix then go on to have to own their own company sell their own makeup and it's been many cases and become incredibly. The powerful influencers and all that business is drawn because of our the impact that this distribution platform and it's incredible ui the basically can take something like wednesday which was not a slam dunk for people to predict that people would love it as much as they do and the ui can pick up on that activity in the early going of the release. And push it out to where it's going to be you know one of our most watched shows in our history all over the world. And and we do use consumer products as a way to intensify fandom. And it could be anything from makeup from wednesday as you said or maybe even a hand on your shoulder spence. Yeah you never know where wednesday is going to show up or at least thing yeah i i didn't get my chance to kind of talk and and. And and at the risk of going back to the management changes and say you know i i am thrilled with the changes. I'm going to miss maybe not seeing read as frequently as he supporting greg and ted so i just. I brought in a little bit of reinforcement with thing even though he's not going anywhere but this way i've got a little daily reinforcement. Sticking with content for a few minutes the local language hits a building but but so here us hits. How do you think about allocating your your 17 billion or so content budget. Between you know genres or languages like is there any way like you can kind of parse it out. Yeah it look good it's it's a it's a big task i quit i'm watching where viewing is growing and where it's suffering and where we are under programming and over private programming around the world is is a big task of the of the job. Spencing his team support bella and her team in making those allocations figuring out between film and television between local language and what is and what's really interesting is there isn't that many. There's that many global hits meaning that everyone in the world watches the same thing. Squid game was very rare in that way and wednesday looks like one of those two very rare in that way. They're coming there are countries like japan and as example or even mexico that have a real preference for local content even when we have our big local hits. And every once in awhile something like squid game is even a big hit in the us. So think about in q4. We had we launched a top 10 non english series nearly every week of the quarter. From south korea from spain from columbia from japan from poland. And so the benefit of that kind of local language investment and the benefit of doing that early. Was that we become exceptional on the ground in those countries. Those content team. I generate not just kind of people want to see but content that's leading the industry. To have netflix produced. The academy award entry film for both mexico and germany has never happened in the history of the oscar. It's really phenomenal and i mentioned earlier that how quiet are the western front and the successive bafta. Keep in mind that these investments are important because it actually increases the total addressable audience for netflix around the world. Cuz if we were just doing english content for the world we would be mostly attracting western centric viewers. But our addressable audience is anyone who's watching tv anywhere in the world. Jessica we have time for one or two last question just want to make sure you have a chance to ask about margins or anything else you might want to ask you something. What an inflection point 1.6 billion dollars in 22. I'm roughly 3 billion and 23 4 billion plus probably in 24. You know can you talk about you know historically you've been more ability than. Then buy is there any change in philosophy as cash starts accelerating can you talk about overall capital priorities. And what's driving that operating margin increase. Spencer why don't you go first with the capital location philosophy if you if you like. Sure thanks jessica so as we run the letter no change at all to our capital. Structure policy or allocation guidance which is to first and foremost reinvest in the core business. And selective acquisitions after that that those are the main priorities. Beyond that if we have a cash in excess of our minimum cash levels which we. Which is roughly two equates to 2 months of revenue and then we'll return that to shareholders so if you are sure buyback program. Yeah and i can pick up with margins that i can start with it's a bit of an explanation but if you like in terms of just in the in the nearest term or outlook for 23 and then just generally what's driving our our outlook but what you saw in in the letter and you know it kind of dates back frankly if we if we walk back to where we were in the beginning of 2022 when we saw slowing revenue growth we said we're going to manage to a target operating margin of 19 to 20%. Fx neutral at those january 2022 rates. And we ended the year 20% so at the high end of that range. And now as we kind of turn the page to 23. You know your first i should say with everything we talked about were we've got we're quite optimistic in terms of our path forward i also just want to highlight there is also. I'm at kind of short-term unusual amount of. Less visibility than typical because we you know these things were talking about in terms of our revenue initiatives whether it's scaling or as platform launching page sharing which hasn't globally rolled out yet these things are early days and then also you know all multinationals have a level of macro uncertainty so that that's a bit of a caveat in terms of the variability in the forecast but but what we see is. We see with the our path to accelerating revenue growth in our high confidence there that is your turn forward to 23. We're guiding to now 21 to 22%. Fx neutral operating margins at that the same january 2022 rates. We're now in a new year so we take it forward to to january 23 to current rates. And that's a range of our operating margin guidance of 18 to 20% so now fx neutral for 23 we're going to manage within that van to deliver at least with an 18 to 20% operating margin guide. So that is. Growing margins growing absolute profit and really what's reflected in there is that this we have high confidence our ability to accelerate revenue throughout the course of the year as we scale ads and we launch paid sharing we've got high confidence in improving you know the service and the strength of our contents later with everything that that ted discussed here on the call. And we're also continue to manage our our cost structure with increasing discipline you saw that in the back half of 22 with our slowing expense growth and will carry that through similarly in 23 so that all lends itself to you know are our focus which is kind of healthy growing and you know double digit revenue growth and accelerating that revenue growth throughout the year expanding are both our prof absolute profit and profit margin and then growing you know positive free cash flow so that's that's all reflected again with the big caveat that there's a bit less visibility than typical in this near term that something will continue to work work through we'll know a lot more over the next couple quarters few quarters as we roll out page sharing and we'll we'll update guidance of that cash flow generation that you see where we believe with all those dynamics. And managing it about the same level of cash content spend that will have more than 3 billion at least 3 billion of free cash flow in. Thank you i spent for that answer and jessica for that last question all your questions and before i turn it over to. Read for closing remarks i just want to say as a long time netflix employee.
