He's up recorded another strong quarter of double d's sales growth at constant currency. Are you going international continue to show a sequential improvement in results and in key channel performing indicators such as activity and productivity. The body shop continue to post challenging results channel that results channel with decline in the 8th at home segment and slower franchise recovery.

And we start to implement steps to give each brand and business marltonaby and responsibility as mentioned when we started this process. Other steps are also advancing. Your further accelerating the integration of the avon and the to the business in latin america. The so-called wave 2. Starting in 2023 with peru and colombia and then followed by brazil. This new phase aims at harmonizing the distribution and cell system. And optimizing the product portfolio. We have already started to optimize our geographic footprint at avon international.

We should result in considerable savings on a recurring basis beginning next year. Also as announcing the material effect publish on october 17. We continue to analyze strategic opportunities for isa. It is worth highlighting that we have never considered selling 100% of ease up to third parties and the strategic opportunities that we are analyzing are focus on accelerating growth and unlocking value. This is strategic change. Application for ease of understudy and our expectation of a continuous challenging and uncertain micro environment in some. That does withdraw the three year guidance released to the market in april 2021. And further modified. In november 2021 and may 2022. We are continuing our ongoing work to improve the fundamentals of our brands and business. And notably the underperforming regions. Which we regard as our principal challenge but also our main upside driver. Our priority remains very clear. We are strongly focused on improving margins and generating cash flow. And the teams in the views are all mobilized and incentiv. What you can discuss. The aim is to deliver sustainable shareholder return and achieve our ambition of making a tuning company the best beauty company for the world. We'll keep you updated on the progress. With that let me know hand over to give to comment on our third quarter performance in greater det. Thank you father and hello to everyone. I'll start with that turning codes consolidated revenue on slide 5. Which grew by 2.2% in constant currency improves sequentially despite the challenging macro environment. You realize sales were down 5.7%. We look at the performance maybe you shortly. But in a nutshell we post a solid growth and a twinkle at sam with a strong performance by the natural brand and they even cft. Any sub continues to post double digit growth at constant currency. Evening international improved sequentially. But it's performance was a student packed by the war in russia. They bought a shop had another difficult quarter for my decreasing the body shop at home. While retail recovers is slowly from the pandemic. We trying to adjust the margins like six which was a stable at 8.6% in q3. These reflected different moving parts. First the main part of impacts are an important improvement of holding expenses which are down nearly 50% year on year. This is the result of our efforts to create a linear and simpler organization. Also improving margin and a touring cooler. Driven by strong top line performance street cost control. We continue to deliver cost efficiencies in sg&e across all the use. Which are more than compensating for commodities and effects pressures in gross margin. This benefits were upset by the conjunction of continuous sales leverage at the body shop. And also continuing investments for sustainable growth at. Those lights 7 we focus on that income and underlying that income. That ain't coming to three was negative 560 million. He was due mainly to lower abidad and hire not financial expenses. Partially upset by some tax credits associated to brazil's tax on foreign income related to 2021. Let me remind you that q321 that income had also benefited from even higher tax games related to credit recovers in brazil. Underlying that income was a negative 198 million rei. And these light shows you the bridge from that in. The difference between the two comes from transformation causes for 163 million realize. 76 marie ice from discontinue operations. In a ppa effect from the acquisition of avon for $124 million real. It was my date we focus on free cash flow. Which as we have communicator before. He's one of our biggest spray whites. We record an outflow of nearly 129 million re. Has action taken to improve cash conversion is trying to take. This shows an improvement of more than 400 million results from the q321 outflow of nearly 543 million. This was reason by improvement in working capital. Which was a positive 353 million. Compare to unfavorable 268 mg ice in q321. You even mainly by sharply improved with inventory efficiencies and account payable. Finally it is worth measuring that spide is still charging outcome and leverage position which we will comment more on the nexus light. The improvements already delivered allow us to post on almost flat free cash flow to. Those line 9 we look at our liquidity profile. We ended the quarter with a cash position of 4.6 billion. Aren't that will be that ratio is to the 2.85 times a quarter end. Up from 2.46 times into two and 1.83 times into two of last year. These lavish ratio. Reflects a lower abd. Give an effects and cause pressures. Jointly with a higher integration cost. You see on the second graph our cash position of 4.6 billion rise is higher than the total of our debt payments through 2027. The average maturity for that is 6.8 years and we face limited debt repayments until 2028. In line with the group's liability management plan to improve its capital structure. Naturals asian september 19th $500 million commercial notes. Maturing 2025. Guaranteed by natural hold. It fines were used primarily to repay them a treat of the 9th issues of the batteries of nature coast match. Which mature on 21st of september. Any october 2022. Natural coz magical is completed the issuance of a little over 1 billion realize in real estate with civil certific. My tour in between 20 and 27 and 2032. Let's turn down to our performance by business unit beginning on july 11th with natur. Which poster another solid performance. Tournament sales were up by solid 10.2% in coastal currency. It was driven by double digit growth and then attura brand which grew by 18.5% at currency. Well the avon brand was also up slightly in constant. Thanks the group in beauty. Dinner tour brand game momentum over the previous quarter and posterior near growth of 19.3% in brazil. Supported by an acceleration in consulting productivity. Up by 21.4% in q3. And hispanic latin net revenue was up 17.3% that constant currency. Is 0.3% in real. Growth was many driven by argentina and colombia. Excluding argentina sales in hispanic markets were down in low single digit. At concentr. Infected by a weaker performance in mexico and a declining chile. Have they even brandon lat. Metro avenue group a 0.7% that goes and. In brazil trans continue the sequential improvement we have seen every quarter. Since you 3 2021. Thank you three not revenues declined by 1.4%. It's important to highlight that the beauty segments actually grew by 11%. Which was upset by 26% sales contraction in fashion home. The beauty segment in brazil saw a double digit game in consultant product. And hispanic markets natural avenue was up 2.3% that constant. Many driven by ecuador and argentina. But in fact the bad decreasing mexico and chile. The beauty category grew 9% in constant currency. But this was mostly upset about dropping fashion home. Total number of available representatives improved sequ. And what's up 6% rescue 222. But it's still down 9.6%. It was like 12 we turn to natural attempts q3 adjusted to be dam. Has shown the graph i just said it'd be die increased signific. My 22.7%. Well margin at 11.3% was up 170 bips. This result was supported by strong top line performance but not to a brand. Strict financial discipline. However this was special upset by the impact of selling expenses increasing as percentage of net sales. Reflecting a tour of brand investments combined with a deterioration in gross march. The situation is many due to value added input price dynamics. Which are pressured by rising energy prices wage inflation and foreign exchange. Let's now move to haven international news live 14. Bradley was down 8.1% that constant curr. And 19.8% in real. This drop was a stronger impacted by the situation uk. Excluding that. Sales were down unlimited 3.1% that constant curr. And continue to improve sequentially since you want. Sales also reflected lower purchase power in europe. Fundamentos continue to show improvement. And the new commercial model. Now implemented in 20 markets. For more than in the previous quarter. Result in better rapid. Digitalization. Q3 address margin is to the 3.6%. Down three beeps versus the same people last. This was due to gross margin dynamics. But partially offset by more efficient sg&e as a percentage of sales. Given the transformational savings. I just said it with the margin was awesome impacted by the war in ukraine. Excluding that impact. I just said to be that margin would have shown a significant improvement you're on here. Those lights16 we now move to the body shop. 23 not revenue decline 19.5% of constant curr. And 29.8% in real. Football to stores continue to show signs of rec. With star sales rep 7.7% year on year. But it's lower than anticipated as inflation and cost of living has impact the consumer. The improvement is not enough to offset the drop in the at home channel. And high product inventory levels held by our franchise partners during the year. However salad sales at the friendship partners are improving. Which are leading level of stocks to approach for pandemic level. Our business distribution channels in other words on stores e-commerce and franchisee combined. What app is 0.6% on the same store sales base. Showing sequential improvement. Q3 education was 6.3%. Down 11.7% points from q321. Resulting from sales de leverage and gross margin pressures. It is also worth remembering the q321 maybe damaging benefit from the government aids that ended in 2021. In the face of this numbers management is looking closely at the business and continue to act on all the front. Under our control. We have an act of the street cost containment. Minimizing discretionary spent and right sizing the overhead structure in some channels. Also wear stimulating demand from head franchisees by taking advantage of opportunities to manage inventory levels. And focusing on positioning for big fourth quarter sales.

Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. If you have a question please press the star key followed by the one key on your touchtone phone now. If you wish to be removed from the queue please press the star key followed by the number two. We'd like to ask you to limit yourselves to one question each in the q&a session. In our first question will come from guillerm viella of jp morgan. Please go ahead. My father's impala biryani and thanks a lot for taking my questions first i would like to have an idea of think. He thinks of marching that they are charging infrastructure cambridge. Pretty division. Also what it can allow in terms of data analytics and digitalization for. And secondly and more rapid. I like to get a call around not to worry in brazil how much of the 19% grow. What's volumes and how much was price or mix. Thanks a lot. Damn it thanks for the question i'm going to ask you please to repeat your first question because we were not able to to hear very well so if you can please. I repeat your first question that'll be great. Oh no problem i would just like to head to have an idea of being. In terms of margin that the outsourcing available in 18 destruction can bring for the division. And i'm also what that can allow in terms of data analytics and digitalization for the branch. Perfect thank you giving me for the for the for the questions. I think as you probably saw right not only this quarter but in the last in the last two quarters. Avon is investing a lot he needs transformational programs right and aiming to deliver. Significant i asked jenny savings across the world so it's it's both a strategy in terms of top linus as father mention right. Not only boosting its new commercial model but also revisiting the footprint. For some unprofitable markets but also a strategy. Focus in the bottom line with the transformational costs and as we mentioned if. Excluding the the russian ukraine at war at the margins even with the sales leverage will be significantly higher. Thank you three of this year i think there are two things to highlight for evening international. In this particular quarter related to transformation the first one is the closure. Of this 7 facility. Basically as we close which was again. Facility that avon had in the us. For a basically r&d. And that's basically. Boost generation savings on an annual basis. And the second one is related to the outsourcing of it which is also a key program for avon transformational program transformational program there are significant results that were aiming to get from both of these initiatives with with. Compelling payback. Hi in terms of investments and returns however we don't close necessarily the the necessary return for those investments. As you can see in this quarter though what we can say is that most of the transformational savings for av. It's related to the outsourcing of the it program so most of the cost is that we are going through this quarter. In terms of transformational savings as you can send the table if i just read. Is it related to two days and as i said before. Both are suffering and and the outsourcing of it. Both of them they have a pre compelling payback that we expect to flow into the bottom line of avon starting 2023. Now on the digitalization program. Basically i'm going to start talking a little bit about international then i'm going to pass through to mention a little bit about about. But we continue to evolve on unable international ass plan of course with some at description in in in different countries with a few countries evolving more than the others. But as you look high in our in our research the penetration of the avon map. Basically measured by the active wraps right who log in at least once in the last three campaigns richard almost 20%. Add this water right which is a 7% point increase. Compared to to the previous one right so we continue very much focus on that. As i mentioned some countries are evolving more than more than the others. But this is one of the key pillars for for for even going forward. I'm going to pass to jerome so he can mention a little bit about about that time. So we learn to your question on on top line growth of the brand in brazil it came both from price and volume. That's pretty much clear thanks a lot. The next question comes from andrew rubin of morgan stanley please go ahead. Hi thanks very much for the question we're just hoping to clarify on the guidance to understanding though withdrawal of the 2024 targets but as it pertains to the synergies of curious with the withdrawal how you're thinking about the synergy opportunity if there's any change fundamentally about the opportunities between the companies and and any updates on how you might be tracking. Thank you. So so just making sure that i understood the question correctly the question is about the the withdrawal of the the guidance and in more particular the synergy guidance right is that correct. That's exactly it thank you perfectly. Where we're getting some background noise here so the the sounds not perfect so sorry i'm repeating every question but but lane and and i reached that point. With with the the new strategic program going on right starting with basically. The the holding restructuring right followed by the acceleration. Off the integration in in the term right in front of illinois wave 2. And the strategic options that we are analyzing for esop based on the material fact that we insured by last month. And of course given the certain scenario as well. We thought that would be a good moment for us to withdraw the the all the guidance that we have. Especially because again we're not planning to give any midterm guidance anymore right. So didn't make sense for us to keep just a synergy basically guidance. When we are also we drawing baby that guidance and revenue guidance when you know that everything is combined to the same thing. What i can say though is that the sandwiches were on track rise of the synergies delivered by wave 1. Big lot. They were on track. Part of those signatures of course they were consumed by the very high and charging inflationary pressures right. That we face in the last time in the last couple of years. But but the plan was on track and we continue to to work on the plan and delivers now we are entering a new face for the time right that's wrong. I can explain more wearing. For the acceleration of wave 2 which of course brings different benefits. For us both in the top line and bottom line. And we thought that again didn't make sense for us to to keep basing and leading the market in the in the previous guidance. Given everything that is going on and as i mentioned a new opportunities ahead of us with the with the wave between letter. Great very clear and appreciate your clarifying that thank you. Question comes from gabriella morias of italian baby. Please go ahead. Hello guys good morning thank you so much for taking my questions we would like to make one question regarding as. Also we have been the company making successful efforts to enter in china and because of that we have been seeing a partial pressure in the division of capability as expected but we would like to get more color on how these answering processes into china has been going on so far. Aw that's basically you guys thank you. Gabriella thanks for for your question yeah we're quite excited with another strong quarter of of esop results and quite excited as you mentioned. With our plans for china entry right which is we mentioned in in the future results and i'll also in the key one results. Are our planning to to happen before your end so we're still planning. To open two stores in shanghai. By 2022 right and we're quite excited with the progress that the team has made there with with the retail and of course. How the business is is evolving in terms of product registration. And and everything else so we are quite excited with that china has been in. Again in the plans for him soap for already. A couple of years and and finance happened. Just to put a little bit more caller right on how important this is for free stuff right. Asia is the largest market for for use up in the world as you probably recall in a couple of calls before. We have mentioned how important is the the japan in the south korea market. For you so bright both of those markets. I've been there the the largest markets for you so in the world. Asia continue to deliver very strong double digit growth in into three so. The brand continues with a very strong pace on the same store sale basis. But also we thought with a new store launch. Our fragrances are. Doing extremely well as well in the regions specifically in south korea. And and needless to say there is a there's a big. Halo impact right specially for the gwendong province when you look at china. For all the regions in in asia right in hong kong and another and other another and other countries right so. Quite excited with that we are following basically urban center approach in the beginning so as i said the focus in the beginning. I will be in in shanghai but the the team is already making plans to to expand that to other urban centers after that. And we truly believe that in a few years china will be a key market for esop in the world and continue to push ahead the apex sales in the future. The next question comes from irma cigars of goldman sach. Please go ahead. Yes hi thank you i was curious just to hear a little bit about cost precious going forward obviously we're seeing some commodity price pressure debating but as you commented in the release and and your earlier remarks is obviously still also inventories to work through and given that you buy a lot of finished product is obviously like long as cycle until that works its way into your cost line so let's just curious help us understand a little bit maybe how we think how we should think about cost pressure. Into 2023 can this the turn already along the next year from a headwind into a tailwind in your in your mind and maybe related to that if you could just make some comments on. It feels like you've seen maybe somewhat a suicide but in pretty much all markets you've seen gross margin pressure from. From cost inflation so just sort of showing that you weren't able to pass all of that through i was just curious to sort of to see some differences in pricing power that you that you feel given the economic backdrop across the different different brands if you just sort of outlay where you've seen more pricing power versus where it's just been a little bit more difficult thank you. Thank you very much thanks for a question yeah look i mean we've been talking a lot about the dispressure of commodities. Nfx right let's not forget fx especially. For a company like the tour of their operations in separate countries not only your facing constant. Transactional fx challenges but also translational effects changes right as country mix. Play some a big role in this in this equation. So we look two free life and i'm going to start talking a little bit about you three just just to to set up the stage here and make sure that we understand a little bit the past going forward but but q3. As you can see we had different dynamics for each one of our views right so putting needs of a side which again didn't face any pressure. In terms of gross margin. As you can see last time i only had 40 beep. A pressure compared to previous years right. And and that was mainly because of the revenue management program because the cost pressure was significant right and when i say revenue management. It's very important to distinguish that is not only a price increase game but also a mix game right. And and we had a very good quarter. For the time in terms of mix as we were able to. To adapt to sell a much better to sell out and we see mixing proven across the board. For evening international which was again one of the the big snuggative impacts in in in gross margin it's very important for us to highlight that yes part of that was but the main issue there. Was also effects right we saw a big. Effects translational impact in mixed impacting the overall. Gross margin of the company and needless to say keep in mind that the warring rush ukrain. Also impact to the gross margin of the of the of the company but yes you should expect. Gross margin to be under pressure. Going far because again as we are have always said right i'm not even international with all the other views as well. We we buy the value added material right so it's not only a matter of of commodity prices which are right they are reducing from the pick in several. I several categories. But also it's the the labor inflation the the. Energy prices and so on which of course in a few markets continue skyrock right. I finally they bought a shop just just to mentioned about a shop. Again. Though we are also significant impacted in terms of cause pressure. I think the body shop as we had also mentioned in q2. Is hasn't. Fast fully dead the price increases to the to the to the consumers given the level of inventories. But it's planning to do so over the next few parts right so what to expect. In the future i think as we mentioned into two right. I will continue to see the the pressure in our margins at least in the short term right. Are we mentioned that into two for the for the full second half not only for q3. Ah so you should expect that to to continue i will still have the inventory cycle and again we still have some contracts that we have to renew. Basically the first quarter of last year which we should see again depending on the market conditions some benefits flowing into our p&l later in 2023 right so. I continue to repeat what we said into two. Our expectations is for our top line to continue to trend better. Are going forward we're seeing that basically across the business and we're excited to have a very strong q4 which. As you know. It's our strongest quarter in terms of seasonality. But we should continue to expect to see margins pressure i specially gross margin and and special destiny that is impacted by by labor inflation. Great thank you so much maybe just one follow up there when you talk about the fx precious impacting even international is that because you're producing in some countries and then transferring into other countries and you just have a big mix of a big mix of sort of. Revenue pool and country and the productions concentrated in a few locations and you probably also had to have to move some of those around given the. The war in in russia and ukraine. Everybody let me make just one quick clarification right if we can distinguish the transactional effects risk in the translation of affects risk right the transactional effect risk is is the risk that we. We have again betting pack for margins right in a direct way. And that is to your example when we buy basically from one country to the other when we we brought we we buy their material from. From one particular country. Just to be clear that transactional risk. We hatch for most of the countries okay especially in the short term so that that is hatching of course it is hatch. Did the edge only basically it gives us time to react and and protection the short term right because as you know. Well we should basically adjust the the the price is depending on the market right but that that risk is a risk that is hatching of course. Depending on the impact of the of the of the currencies. That whisper flowing through our hatches now what i meant before which is very important is the mix of countries and that is represented by the translation of fx right. So as we have some countries in haven international that operates. With a high. Gross margins than the others and those countries they may be growing less for declining more. Then the others we have a mixing pack that is reflecting the translational effects and again the overall mix of countries of haven and that's where again we can see some some headwinds in the short term as well so it it is both but i just want to make the the clear distinction that for the transactional effects we have a hedging program in place. But of course we don't hatch the translational impact of fx in our results. Yeah perfect i was what i was trying to understand thank you. The next question comes from gustavo sunday of xp please go ahead. Hi good morning guys thank you for the question my first question is regarding working capital. So inventors played an important role for improving working capital in the quarter. But on top of the unity how are you guys seen inventory levels so far are you comfortable with your current inventory levels for the year end. And can we expect you force cash generation as stronger last year. My second question is by may is regarding evil international's footprint. You mentioning the release you you last albania. I launched partnerships in some other countries so can we expect more moves similar to that in the coming quarters. And what would be enough tomorrow for drinks in terms of numbers of countries avon international operating. Thank you. Think it will stop before a question i'm going to start here and of course i bet you won't be can they can add anything they put relevant we're comfortable. With the level off of inventory is right keep in mind that when we say we're comfortable doesn't mean that we're not happy because even though q3 there is a natural seasonality for us to build inventories right so for for inventory to increase in the balance sheets therefore for you to have a negative impact. In your free cash flow due to this seasonality. And that impact is significantly less. Then then last year. Keep in mind that we're coming from a position of hiding inventory right that says we have also discussed in in the last requires right so it is moving in in in the right direction i think that the actions. That time i did the views have taken to improve. Inventory management is starting to take effect as we mentioned. And we believe that we are again. In a good position for q4. I even though again in some countries we still see some some supply chain issues. That may impact our results but we are quite comfortable with that. I will continue to work on optimizing inventory and optimizing all the accounts of working capital. To improve. The cash conversion going forward now your second question was can you can you remind me the footprint of avon yes thank you. Yes look this is no news ryan and father had mentioned a little bit about that into two and and also in this quarter right this is not only. Let let me be clear is not only about avon right i mean we are of course revisiting. All the countries that we operate there are no profitable right in the world right so. As even operates in in in in more than 40 countries around the world. Internationally i should expect that we have some quite profitable countries there and and another countries that are not that profitable and in operate with losses so i can that has been the focus is basically to to tackle those markets first so as you mentioned we exit a few markets. We we change the operating model in in other markets. I will continue to do so if there is a market there's not profitable i will continue to look for alternatives. Angels markets so i'm going to pass here to father to see if he has anything to add. But basically that internet charity and that's the that's the essence of it. Microsoft with my thank you i'm not much to add i just want to say that we are trying to say revisiting every country. I mean april presence has different levels it can be a full presence can be through distributor can be through a head franchise. So we are also releasing the model in which we operate in order to make that more profitable so we are going through and as angel and saudi arabia we have already made a change of menu just mentioned but of course we are going through every country especially the ones that are not profitable and see how we can wear just a matter of investing for a full presence is the matter of having distribution at franchisee and how to adjust everything so that we can have a profitability in those countries. Thank you. Thank you. This concludes today's question and answer session i would like to invite fabio barbosa to proceed with his closing statements. Please go ahead. Thank you very much for being with us today. As you saw from the presentation we are all operating a very challenging environment. But they have cleared the final priorities we are mobilized to deliver them. And we are optimistic that we can see. If evidence that. Transmade and focus revisit. I was talking to make the difference thanks for your attention and have a great weekend thank you. That concludes the natura and co audio conference for today. Thank you very much for your participation and have a good day.
