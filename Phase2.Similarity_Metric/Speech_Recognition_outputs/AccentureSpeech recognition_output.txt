Well industries and markets are being affected differently there are two common themes. All strategies lead to technology particularly cloud data ai and security which are fundamental to a strong digital core. Are the cloud business is now 26 billion and grew 48%. With cloud first being the biggest driver of the growth. Companies are also seeking to execute compressed transformations second thing. These mean bold programs on accelerated time frames often spanning multiple parts of the enterprise at the same time. Managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platform and talent. And they're turning to accenture because of our excellence across the enterprise. We are unmatched in terms of breadth and dep. Of capabilities and industry coverage. We continue to see a growing number of companies embrace the need to harness the five key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade. Total enterprise reinvention talent sustainability the metaverse continuum and the ongoing tech revolution. Which in turn will fuel our growth. Let me bring this to man to life. Total enterprise reinvention. We are helping our clients transform every part of their business with technology from building a digital core to optimizing operations to achieve agility efficiency and resilience to accelerating their growth agendas. Well it is still early stages there are leading companies that have begun systematically transforming multiple parts of their enterprise from moving to the cloud and adopting new ways of working to digitizing manufacturing to reimagining shared services to creating entirely new business models. Unilever one of the world's largest consumer goods companies is an example of a company that is leading in total enterprise reinvention.

We are leveraging our expertise of nuclear construction and our cutting edge cloud digital and ai capabilities to help edf deliver on one of the largest capital projects in europe and accelerate its mission. Helping britain achieve netzero. And are operation services now 9 billion business with 19% growth in fy22 are fundamental to total enterprise reinvention for our clients because they help our clients digitize faster access digital talent and reduce cost.

And with our continued focus on innovation on the ongoing tech revolution we continue to invest in our business for the future for example and q4 we invested in pixel a leader in cutting edge earth imaging space technology. Thanks julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter fiscal 23 we expect revenues to be in the range of 15.2 to 15.75 billion. This as soon as the impact of fx will be approximately -8.5%. Compared to the first quarter of physical 22. And reflection estimated 10 to 14% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 23. Based upon how the rates have been training over the last few weeks. We currently assume the impact of fx on our results in us dollar. Will be approximately. -6% compared to fiscal 22. For the full physical 23 we expect our revenues to be in the range of 8 to 11% growth of local currency over fiscal 22. Which includes an inorganic contribution of about two and a half percent. Property margin we expect fiscal year 23 to be 15.3 to 15.5%. A 10 to 30 basis point expansion over physical 22 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23 to 25%. This comparison effective tax rate of 24% in physical 22. For ernie's per share we expect full year diluted eps for physical 23 to be in the range of $11.09. $11.41 for 4 to 7% grow. Over fiscal 22 results. For the full physical 23 we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of 8.5 to 9 billion dollars. Property and equipment additions to be approximately $800 million. And free cash flow to be in the range of 7.7 to 8.2 billion. Are free cash flow guidance reflexive free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1. Finally we expect to return at least 7.1 billion through dividends and sherry purchases as we remain committed. To returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. With that let's open it up so that we can take your questions angie. Thanks casey i would ask that you each keep one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question operator would you provide instructions for those on the call. Thank you ladies and gentlemen if you wish to ask a question please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the 10 command. The first question will come from the line of lisa ellis. With market nathanson please go ahead. Hi good morning good stuff here. Just a question about the outlook for physical 23. Can you elaborate a bit further on what underlying macroeconomic outlook you have embedded. And guidance above and beyond you know the six points of fx translation. Maybe the broader question is sort of how how is that all are you seeing. Verizon great environment inflation serve escalating dynamics of what we've been seeing all year long affecting your business thank you. Great thanks lisa let me give you a little bit of color. Around our guidance assumptions. So our revenue range of 8 to 11% for fiscal 23. It includes two and a half percent inorganic contribution and that's compared to about 5% that we did in 22. And that would represent that about 8 and 1/2% organic growth at the upper end of a range. And so we continue to see really strong demand for our services lisa. And as you've seen the most recent estimate for the it services continues. To show the. Car industry will be about 5%. So anywhere in our range it will show us continuing to take share. But at the same time. Or gross is not directly correlated with gdp we read the same things that you do. And the latest gdp estimate for most of the world's largest economies are lower in 2023 than 2022. So again we're calling for double digit growth. At the top part of our range. Another year of double digit growth which would have us adding. Significant scale. Yet again on top of our current 62 billion dollar business. Maybe i'm all at lisa is that. When we think about the macro environment what we're really thinking about is what do our clients need. Right so as so when i talked a little bit about this last quarter right is this environment affects different industries differently so. You got those who are. Really i'm tied to the supply chain disruption and the inflation continuing to focus on cost. But you also see that as the uncertainty increases so. Over the last. You know 90 to 120 days you saw changes in the estimates around. At the gdp growth for 2023. You know it makes all clients really think about okay. What's my resilience is there more that i can do can i take advantage of the environment to push through deeper cost cuts that require you to change you know changing of behavior and so. Really think about the environment as what does that mean we need to do to help our clients and how do we continue to pivot and it's very similar if you think about. What we did in the early days of the pandemic where you know we pivoted a lot to for example cloud you know using all of our learning organization so that's the focus so you know it's always an opportunity to better serve our clients. Okay yeah great color thank you and then just a question follow-up on on bookings realizing they're obviously always lumpy to quarter to quarter and the overall number this quarter was extraordinarily strong continuing that. 1.12 books to bill but is there any it wasn't sort of an unusual shift in. Into outsourcing in less consulting is there any color or call out there or is that just sort of the bakeries of the kind of quarterly quarterly fluctuations. Thank you. Sure and so you know at least as you mentioned we feel really good about our bookings and q4 it was our second highest bookings ever. Highest also being this year in the second quarter. What i really liked about it was driven by broad. Demand so it was across all markets. And our services. And we peel it back we had good book to bill. And all dimensions of our business. And. And. Without forcing. What a record of almost 10 billion and that was almost. 1.3 billion more than what we did for our last record. And we do continue to see a strong pipeline going into the year even with those. The second right second best record bookings. But as i would i will say that as we often do. We have seasonally lower bookings and quarter one. And we are seeing that again this year. Thank you our next question comes from the line of tianjin huang with jp morgan please go ahead. Hey thanks just checking on what lisa just asked there with this. Larger book to bill in outsourcing real estate to consulting is the shift to larger deals does. Tell you or should i tell us anything about client priorities and i'm curious that. Changes or even improves your visibility overall for physical 23 given you have so much more in the way of larger deals in the. In the backlog. Yeah i mean i i don't i mean obviously we've got. You know larger deals you have a more visibility around large deals just because they're larger deals and you see how it is and something really how we think about the business so much i mean i think if you just take a step with your underline questions what are clients focused on right and so what we do see is and what we actually more than just see what we are recommending is that you know leadership teams remain sort of focused on. Prioritizing where they can get you know. Good time to value. Making sure that they are doing things that are material you know not having a thousand different pilots as opposed to actually getting you know to scale. And so a lot of that does lead to. A focus on larger transformation deals and it's tied to what we call total enterprise reinvention right what we're talking to clients about is systematically reinventing and and you know actually we've got some research coming out. At the end of september that says you know 68% of cfo say they today have. Either three or more transformation program. Either going right now or about to start in parallel and so what that really does mean that is that you've got. More companies do what we've been talking about since the early days of the pandemic which is. Systematic transformation. You know we'll try to do it you know faster. And that does lead to the larger programs and probably the bigger impact for us is less about visibility but those obviously convert to revenue differently. Yeah it may change it i'll just add in terms of if you just look at our bookings this year. From an outsourcing type of work compared to consulting type of works compared to our history of the last few years there's really no difference. Right we actually have you know a flight percentage uptick and what we close out this year and consulting type of work bookings versus outsourcing there's no real difference. Intermix very good now that's really helpful just on the my follow up on margins if you don't mind just thinking about investment priorities organic versus inorganic i know it's a lower inorganic assumption on growth this year but any updated there on terms of the balance and i'm wondering you know i wrote down i think you said 48% growth in cloud you know for the year and i think back to the cloud first investment you did i think it was a three billion dollar investment it seems like a good return out of that so can we see more investments like that at this point in the cycle so yeah just think about organic person organic investing thanks. Yes so i'll take the inorganic point and then i'll head it over to julie get some more color but so first of all there's no change overall. To our capital location strategy. Right so we will continue to use vna to fuel our organic growth. And so you'll see you know the two and a half percent engine is an inorganic contribution it's it's generally in the zone of what we've done. You know in in previous years. And and so maybe i'll also just take a chance to talk about what that means in terms of how we're going to invest. I'm in our business next year and how that relates to. How we're seeing our profit because i think it's really important to point out that. We're really proud of what we accomplished this past year and 22 where we did 10 basis points of expansion. Intention we weren't continuing to v. At scale in her business. Right and also in our people particularly this year with managing wage inflation. As we look through next year we expect to continue to invest in our business. We expect wage inflation to continue it's across all industries. And across the globe and for us it's going to vary by geography by skill. And we will navigate that like we did this past year. With a focus on pricing which we all know can like compensation a bit. But just want to point out that we did see the benefit improved pricing in our p&l and 22. And so again we're going to do all of this while changing the mix of people in our contracts and you said technology to absorb the higher investments that we're making organically and high investments that we're making in our people. But so it's really important that we continue on our investment profile. And with that like i would i'd be really happy next year to land anywhere within the 10 to 30 basis points. Of margin expansion. And i would say that based on how we're going to best throughout the year. There's a bit more potential for us to have a more availability a variability in a quarters as we go throughout fiscal year 23 on our way to 10 to 30 basis points of expansion for the year. Yeah and can i just attendant i would just emphasize we believe it is very important to continue to invest at higher levels in our business every year and that's our commitment and you know it's been. You know we think a big reason for our. Success is that through every cycle we continue to invest. Thank you. Thank you our next question will come from the line of keith bachman with bmo please go ahead. Hi many thanks i wanted to ask to start with on the outlook and particular julie. If there's any comments direction or otherwise you could give on bookings. I understand you provided the revenue guidance and consecracy. Even the backlog run off. Of the book of tremendous bookings you've given so far. That the revenue garden seems very reasonable that if not a touch conservative. But if you were indicated in your prepared to march you had record bookings this year. You're facing. What your clients are facing a deeper economic challenge. So is there any comments you could give whether a book the bill or the growth rates or any parameters on how we should be thinking about booking this year cuz it seems like the trajectory there could be different from the revenue growth. But i'll let i'll let casey start and then i'll add on to start with a little bit more color on how we actually see. Revenue can breaking out for for the year so. From a type of work perspective for the full year 23. We do see consulting revenue growth to be you know within our you know within the context of the 1811 that we gave out overall which remember has an 6%. Fx headwind embedded in that we see consulting. Revenue to be high single digits to double digits. An outsourcing we see being double digits. And when you think about what our bookings expectations are what we don't guide the bookings you should you know our view remains the same we look for. Over a rolling four quarters. Period time for a book to bill to be over one. And keep whatever just say is that. Remember. Our focus is helping our clients. Create value. Within whatever environment that they are operating in right so and which is very different depending on your industry so you know like take right now. Providers in the us right. They are focused on. Cost cutting cuz they went through a tough time you know with covid. They're behind the digitization so they're investing there and they have to because they're facing one of the most difficult labor markets they've ever had so now the you know so resistance and difficulty and automating before that is a completely different than a global consumer company like unilever we talked about on our script who's reinventing everything that's you know been on this journey for a few years is you know looking to you know the next thing right and they're dealing with supply chain disruptions right cost input so that is how we continue to succeed is by understanding. The depth of difference in. Our industry we're using knowledge that we had from other industry to now accelerate what the providers are doing because you know they're now implementing. You know sas solutions to connect their patients that we've been doing for years you know in retail right and in banking and in lots of other industries so. Not you know. Outlook for the year reflects our confident that we are going to continue to be able to use that knowledge stay close to our clients and deliver on what they need. Okay okay thank you my follow up with it is then focused on free cash flow. She cash flow guidance is is a touch certainly lighter than. We had mild and i think street had modeled. Your margins continue to move higher so it's just wondering what the. Put some takes that you might want to call out. With the free cash flow guidance for the year and then i will see the floor many thanks. Yeah thanks keith so. As you know when we said our guidance we always first start with looking at the ratio so. The ratio that we have in our free cash flow guidance. A very strong 1.1. Free cash flow to net income ratio so we're happy with that. We also are allowing in that guidance. A bit of an uptick in dsos from our current level. And then also we know our assuming either we are going to have the fx impact of you know 6% that will obviously impact our free cash flow as well and as you know it's not unusual for us to start. At the beginning of the year with a free cash flow got its range that's below where we deliver the previous year. Okay okay many thanks. Thank you our next question comes from the line of brian king with deutsche bank please go ahead. Hi good morning you know obviously a lot of folks are asking about the macro so just curious how the macro has changed for you guys over the last 3 months. And how that's influence your business cuz it doesn't really show up much in results. So just curious how you would how you would frame that. Well as. As casey said earlier our guidance for the year takes into account the current estimates for 2023 for gdp which as we all know over the last 30 days have have decreased so we take that into consideration and where we see that really affecting our business is. Our ability to help our clients and think about what to do right how do you execute a faster transformation are there new opportunities i'm talking to. Consumer goods client now where you know where you know helping them think about well how do we cut marketing and get more effective because they need growth but marketing is one of the biggest spend areas for consumer goods company and you know by the way let's not waste a good environment to you know be able to catalyze. Cultural and behavioral change you know as i think about things so that's where we are seeing it and otherwise our guidance reflects you know you know as you know it's not a it's not a one for one but we we obviously take into account the economic environment. Got it yeah yeah i was just looking at europe in particular up 26% in local currency given all the concerns around europe it's just a pretty. Amazing number doesn't seem to have come off much from the growth rate you've been putting up because they are really close to our clients a little bit of color on that you know we have. You know for the first quarter. And john you know when we look at the markets we we see all the markets for the for the first quarter within that 10 to 14% revenue range that we get gave. They all have the potential to be double digits that includes europe. And then also for the consulting type of work in q1. We see a high single digit to load double digit growth range. Within that 10 to 14. And i would peel back consulting a little bit for you too within consulting we see that the tech portion of consulting the systems integration will have continued strong demand and s&c we expect to be in lower single digits. No that's really helpful and then just a quick follow-up just thinking on casey on visibility how is visibility changed at all if at all for a center when you look out. Further on in the quarters you know as we get. Q4 it's obviously almost 12 months away so it'll probably a little bit hard to figure out exactly. The right growth rates but just thinking about the visibility of the business. So obviously brian that you know in terms of looking at the back half of the year i mean that's no different than the way it is honestly every year you know we talked a lot about what we just mentioned on how we look at the macro in the market but you know the back half of the year you know we we always. You know it's always less certain at this time of the year then and then obviously the first quarter in the first half a different than what we have experience every year and as always clients still most of our clients are calendar year and they'll set their budget she know and will know more about that in january so it's it's really the same. Got it great congrats on the results. Thank you. Thank you our next question comes from james fawcett with morgan stanley please go ahead. Thank you very much i appreciate all the commentary today as as usual i'm looking at kind of the supply and and kind of how you're managing your own employees etc. How does the the shifting client priorities manifest itself in where and how your services are being delivered and. And how is that influencing your talent strategy right now around pace of hiring where you hire etc. All right well as you know. You know we have a very deep competency in supply and demand and and actually over the course of the last couple of years we continue to innovate we have a incredible what we call integrated talent control tower that is able to predict earlier and earlier. I'm in our sales cycle where the skills will be needed and what type of skills and so you know for us this is just normal business right and and you know keep in mind technology demand is really incredible right i mean you you saw that in our results all strategies lead to technology and you know we're super pleased with not only our performance there but you know what we're seeing ahead as clients continue to build the digital core as. Fundamental to all of their other strategic needs and you know our talent supply chain is able to see that predicted understand the skills and keep you know keep moving forward. That's great then turning to pricing just wondering. What the the town and counter of pricing conversations have been. Although some progressed and you know how are you building in or how should we think about what's being built into your formulation about look around magnitude of potential uplift revenue from pricing versus margins etc. So let me just remind you that when i'm talking about pricing and my answer. I'm talking about the martin on the work that we've sold. And i'm really pleased that we've continued to improvements in pricing. And we are seeing the benefits i mentioned this earlier but i'll just repeat it we are seeing the benefits come through in our p&l. And we continue to focus on. And proven some pricing as we enter into the fiscal year 23 so i'm really. I'm really pleased with the progress we've made. That's great thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you in our next question will come from the line of jason kupperburg with bank of america please go ahead. Morning guys thanks casey just wanted to pick up on your comment on one of the prior questions around i think you said strategy and consulting up in the low single digit range and q1 so. Curious about the same kind of range you anticipate for the full year fiscal 23 and is that below corporate average level just reflective of the more kind of discretionary nature and growth oriented nature of those. Services. Do you think thanks jason in terms of q1 it's really just a few simple things one we got a tough compare. Too is there's less when i mentioned a lesson organic that really does also hit in essence in the s&c parts. And then it's julie talked about you know a lot of us can see practitioners are really focused on some a lot of the larger transformational deals. And that just has jason different a different revenue yield and it believes in later throughout the year. Okay understood maybe just turn into the supply side for a second looks like attrition was unchanged in q4 versus q3. Wondering what you're expecting there in fiscal 23 as well as. What you're expecting for wage inflation relative to 2022 and whether or not some of the broader layoffs across other parts of the tech industry is that taking some of the pressure off. Some of your supply metrics at all. Guess i'll start chasing with the last part i mean we had. I really pleased with the way we. We're able to. Grow a scale profitably well managing the wage inflation and fy22 and as i said a little bit earlier but just to repeat we do expect wage inflation to continue and we have factored that. Into our guidance. Yeah and look i would just say to you that. Technology skills are in demand by both companies you know as well as our competitors because technology is at the core of strategy and so we're expecting to have a continued tight labor market and we are continue to expect us to really excel because despite that market you know as you know even this last year we added a hundred thousand people so i don't know the fact that there's been some layoffs and you know certain markets has isn't really i think going to change much. Thank you. Operator we have time for one more question and then julie will wrap up the call. Thank you and that question will come from the line of brian bergen with colin please go ahead. Hi good morning thank you i wanted to start on the growth outlook can you just give us a sense on how you thinking about the second half trajectory you just in the physical 23 range just giving a significant uncertainty just curious how you went about building that so i can have forecast and then just within the year are you expecting the strategic priorities to hold a double digit growth so across song and cloud first the next or any of those a little bit more exposed to potential slow down and uncertainty. Yep so i'll maybe just start with the overall outlook that we have right so. You can see that we started with eight you know 8 to 11 already gave you know that the colors on that so and within that obviously we have a strong start at 10 to 14% growth. And. In terms of really what that looks like for the rest of the year i mean we'll continue to give guidance like we typically do as we progress. True fy23. I mean it's julie mentioned we see continued strong demand. And our technology are areas of technology. And you know other than. That we don't really give any more guidance and kind of view on revenue outlook. Then what i've already shared yeah and just i think it's always important that we are continuously thinking about. Both the near term this fiscal year and the longer term and anchoring on the 5 forces of change for the next decade and so total enterprise reinvention talent you know we talked about the investments we're making in sustainability we just made a great acquisition this quarter and carbon intelligence which is all about you know consulting around carbon getting to net zero strategies the metaverse continuum you know small today where the leading enterprise you know user in our own way of onboarding but you know lots and lots of interest and we're already you know making those investments and then the ongoing tech revolution and so that's why you think about our results right we are investing for today and tomorrow and really are you know looking at. The demand that we see you know over the next decade and it looks like just on m&a it looks like it did close on more and 4 q then you initially anticipated so how should we think about the plan spend in physical 23 for m&a underlying the two and a half percent growth contribution and then just how do you start off the year in one cue what's the inorganic assumption in the in the outlook. Thank you so you're right we did end up spending 3.4 billion for the year and 22. Because we were able to get some of the regulatory approvals. I've done this last fiscal year 22 that we weren't sure of the timing. And you know you'll see that because of that word well we're going to continue to always provide the inorganic. Outlook. Full year basis so that two and a half is a full year we're not we don't really do that by quarter cuz i can again can also be lumpy. We're not going to continue to provide the. Capital location amount. As we go into 23 just because it can it can really vary by the end of the end of the year and we'll be able to you'll be able to see it and we'll report it every quarter. Yes probably with reminding that last q1 we had umlaut and nevada which were both very large acquisitions come in and q1 so probably just good to remind everyone that's part of what's driving the q1sc results too. So before we wrap up i do want to mention that angie park who has been our head of investor relations for the past 6 years has been promoted to become the cfo for our really outstanding technology services business angie has been an absolutely incredible head of ir and we're particularly grateful for how she has helped lead us through some of the most turbulent times in the history of accenture i know from speaking to our investors and analysts how much they've appreciated. Angie's steady hand her commitment to transparency and connection and i know we'll all miss her in this role but are extremely excited to see her start the next chapter of what he's already been an incredible career so thank you very much angie and i'm also pleased to welcome katie o'connor who will become our new head of investor relation she's got incredible experience she's held many finance rules to her 25 years at accenture and so please join me in welcoming katie and i know she's looking forward to getting to know all of you in the days ahead.
