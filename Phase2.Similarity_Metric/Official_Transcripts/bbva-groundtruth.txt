Good morning everyone, and welcome to BBVA Argentina’s third quarter 2022 earnings Conference Call. 
Today's webinar will be supported by a slide presentation available on our investor relations website on the 
Financial Information section.
Speaking during today’s call will be Inés Lanusse, our Investor Relations Officer, and Carmen Morillo Arroyo,

Please note that starting January first 2020, as per Central Bank regulation, we have begun reporting results 
applying hyperinflation accounting pursuant to IFRS Rule IAS 29. For ease of comparability, 2021 and 2022
figures have been restated to reflect the accumulated effect of the inflation adjustment for each period 
through September 30th
, 2022.
Now, let me turn the call over to Inés…
Thank you Belen, and thank all of you for joining us today.
As we are all aware, the combination of an unstable global context, the difficulties of our country to correct 
current macroeconomic distortions and to meetthe established objectives in the loan agreement with the IMF, 
local market volatility continues, especially in the FX markets and local currency debt markets. A high 
uncertainty persists about the future development of economic policy. 
Being this said, Argentina has been able to continue with its economic recovery, although within a context that 
presents great challenges, with a sustained high inflation and a capped foreign exchange rate.
BBVA Argentina has a corporate responsibility with society, characteristic of the Bank’s business model, 
which encourages inclusion, financial education and supports scientific research and culture. The Bank works 
with the highest integrity, long-term vision and best practices, and is present through the BBVA Group in the 
main sustainability indexes.
Moving into business dynamics, as you can see on slide 3 of the webcast presentation, our service offering has 
evolved in such a way that by the end of September 2022, retail digital client penetration reached 62% slightly 
increasing from a year back, while that of retail mobile clients reached 55% from 52% as of the same period of last year. The response on the side of customers has been satisfactory, and we are convinced this is the 
path to pursue, in the aim of sustaining and expanding our competitive position in the financial system.
Retail digital sales have increased from 79.6% in 3Q21 to 83.4% of units and represent 55.7% of the Banks 
total sales measured in monetary value, vs 52.8% in 3Q21. 
New customer acquisition through digital channels reached 66% in 3Q22, from 67% in 3Q21.
The Bank actively monitors its business, financial conditions and operating results, in the aim of keeping a 
competitive position to face contextual challenges.
Moving to slide 4, I will now comment on the bank’s 3Q22 financial results.
BBVA Argentina 3Q22 net income was 9.7 billion pesos, decreasing 50% quarter-over-quarter. This implied a 
quarterly ROE of 13.5% and a quarterly ROA of 2.4%.
Operating income in 3Q22 was 48.4 billion pesos, 24% above the 39 billion pesos recorded in 2Q22.
Quarterly operating results are mainly explained by (1) greater interest income, (2) higher income from 
measurement of financial instruments at fair value through P&L, and (3) lower operating expenses, mainly 
personnel expenses. This allowed net operating income to increase above operating expenses.
These effects were partially offset by a fall in net fee income, mainly affected by the negative effect of inflation.
Net income for the period fell 50% QoQ due to the contrast generated by the effects of a benefit in the income 
tax line, as a result of the implications of tax deferrals, recorded in 2Q22.
In the first nine months of 2022, the accumulated net income was 34.8 billion pesos, 28% above the 27.2 
billion pesos recorded in the first nine months of 2021. The nine month accumulated ROA reached 2.9% while 
the nine month accumulated ROE was 16.8%.
Turning into the P&L lines in slide 5, Net interest income for 3Q22 was 76.6 billion pesos, increasing 15.6%
QoQ, and 43.3% YoY.
In 3Q22, interest income, in monetary terms, increased more than interest expense, mainly due to (1) higher 
income from government securities, (2) an increase in income from interests from loans, in particular 
overdrafts and discounted instruments, and (3) increases in income from CER/UVA clause adjustments. The 
items mentioned take place in a context of increasing interest rates, derived from sequential increases in the 
monetary policy rate by the BCRA, as well as an increase in the inflation rate.
In the quarter, interest income totaled 144.3 billion pesos, increasing 18.8% compared to 2Q22. Quarterly
increase is mainly driven by (1) higher income from government securities, both from an increase in the 
nominal rate and the volume in the position of LELIQ; and (2) an increase in interests from loans, mainly 
overdrafts and discounted instruments, especially due to the increment in interest rates and higher activity.
Interest expenses totaled 67.7 billion pesos, denoting a 22.5% increase QoQ. Quarterly increase is described 
by higher time deposit expenses, together with higher CER/UVA adjustment expenses.
Interests from time deposits (including investment accounts) explain 70.9% of interest expenses, versus 
69.3% the previous quarter. 
Net fee income as of 3Q22 totaled 9.1 billion pesos, decreasing 27.5% QoQ.
In 3Q22, fee income fell 5.9%, mainly explained by a decline in fees from credit cards, mostly due to the effect 
of inflation, and an increase in the use of the Puntos BBVA benefit program. This was offset by an increase in
fees linked to deposits, given to the average increase in prices of accounts and packaged maintenance, during
the month of September.
Regarding fee expenses, these increased 48.4% QoQ. Higher expenses in the quarter are partially explained 
by expenditures linked to credit and debit cards, due to higher client acquisition costs.
On 3Q22, loan loss allowances increased 37%, mainly due to the periodic update of macroeconomic scenarios 
in IFRS 9 impairment models.
During 3Q22, total operating expenses were 43.8 billion pesos, decreasing 2.9% QoQ. 32% were personnel 
benefits versus 34% on 2Q22.
During the quarter personnel benefits fell 10.6% QoQ. The quarterly decrease is partially explained by the 
retroactive effect of wage increments impacted in 2Q22. This past effect surpasses the collective agreement 
with unions corresponding to 3Q22 and the revaluation of stock of vacation not taken. 
As of 3Q22, administrative expenses also decreased 1.8% QoQ. The quarterly decrease is partially explained by 
(1) a reduction in rent, (2) greater efficiency in armored transportation and (3) an improvement in maintenance, 
electricity and advertising costs, among others.
The accumulated efficiency ratio as of 3Q22 was 69%, improving compared to the 71.3% reported in 2Q22. The 
quarterly improvement is explained by a decrease in expenses, and also an increase in income, both due to a
reduction in expenses as well as a significant increase in interest income.
In terms of activity, on slide 6, total consolidated financing to the private sector in 3Q22 totaled 582.4 billion
pesos, falling 8% QoQ, and 6.4% YoY.
Loans to the private sector in pesos decreased 6.3% in 3Q22. During the quarter, the decline was especially 
driven by an 8.6% fall in credit card, a 13.6% decrease in other loans, followed by a 5.7% fall in consumer loans. 
Regarding other loans, the main fall is observed in commercial loans (“PIV”). These decreases were offset by a 
6.4% and a 27.5% increase in overdrafts and in receivables from financial leases.
Loans to the private sector denominated in foreign currency fell 27.8% QoQ. Quarterly decrease is mainly 
explained by a 47.9% decline in other loans, followed by a 22.4% fall in prefinancing and financing of exports, 
and a 12.5% fall in credit cards.
During the quarter, both the retail and the commercial portfolio, fell in real terms.
Loan portfolios were highly impacted by the effect of inflation during the third quarter of 2022, which reached 
22%. In nominal terms, BBVA Argentina managed to increase the total loan portfolio by 11.9% during the 
quarter.
BBVA Argentina’s consolidated market share of private sector loans reached 8.47% as of the 3Q22 improving 
from 8.10% a year ago.
In 3Q22, asset quality ratio or NPL was 1.07%, compared to the 1.08% recorded in 2Q22. This is mainly 
explained by a similar percentage reduction of both the non-performing portfolio as well as the total portfolio.
The coverage ratio was 236.87% in 3Q22, above the 219.39% recorded in 2Q22. The increase in coverage is 
merely the product of a greater fall in the non-performing portfolio versus a lower percentage fall of allowances.
Cost of risk reached 2.65% as of 3Q22, above 2Q22’s 1.94%. This is mostly explained by growth in loan loss 
allowances in the quarter, mainly due to the periodic update of macroeconomic scenarios in IFRS 9 impairment 
models.
On the funding side, as seen on slide 7, private non-financial sector deposits in 3Q22 totaled 1.1 trillion pesos, 
falling 9.9% QoQ, and 7.2% YoY. Quarterly decrease was mainly explained by sight deposits.
The Bank’s consolidated market share of private deposits reached 6.68% as of 3Q22.
Private non-financial sector deposits in pesos, decreased 9.8% compared to 2Q22. The quarterly change is 
mainly affected by a decrease in sight deposits, especially checking accounts by 23.3%, followed by saving 
accounts by 17.9%. This was partially offset by an increase in investment accounts by 14.7%.
Private non-financial sector deposits in foreign currency expressed in pesos fell 10.6% QoQ. As of 3Q22, the 
Bank’s transactional deposits, considering checking accounts and savings accounts represented 55.2% of total 
non-financial private deposits versus 60.2% in 2Q22.
In terms of capitalization, BBVA Argentina continues to show strong solvency indicators on 3Q22. Capital ratio 
reached 26.2%.
Exposure to the public sector in 3Q22, excluding central bank instruments, represented 9.8% of total assets, 
slightly above the 9% in 2Q22 and way below the 15.1% reported by the System as of August 2022.
It is worth mentioning that as of the date of this report, BBVA Argentina has distributed dividends by 12.1 billion
pesos (instalments 1 to 11) according to the established schedule published on June 16, 2022. The 12 and last 
installment, was announced last Friday, November 18th.
The bank’s total liquidity ratio remained healthy at 79% of total deposits as of September30th.
