For evaluation tehniques I've chosen Dice coefficent and WER(Word-error-rate). Dice Index (range 0-1, 0-no similarity, 1-same) is working with Bag-of-words while WER is 
similarity metric which uses the order of the words.

Dice example:

Conclusion: Speech_Recognition works awsome with short videos (max len 30min) ,but when it comes to longer videos the performance is much worse.
